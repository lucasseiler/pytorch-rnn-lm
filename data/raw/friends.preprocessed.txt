Look , what do you want me to say ?
I want you to say that you like her !
I can &apos;t . It &apos;s like this <unk> thing , you know . Every time she starts laughing , I just wanna pull my arm off just so that I can have something to throw at her .
Thanks for trying . Oh , and by the way there is no Count Rushmore !
Yeah , then-then who &apos;s the guy that painted the faces on the mountain ?
How could you have told her ?
Ross , I didn &apos;t think it would that big of a deal .
Oh , she didn &apos;t think it would be that big of deal .
Okay , who are you talking to when you do that ?
Look , that was supposed to be like a private , personal thing between us .
Okay , Ross , Phoebe is my girlfriend , okay , we tell each other everything . You know , I mean , come on , guys do the same thing , I mean , what about all that <unk> room stuff .
That &apos;s different , okay . That &apos;s like , uh &apos; Who dated a stripper ? &apos; or &apos; Who did it on the back of the <unk> Island <unk> ? &apos; .
Were both of those Joey ?
Yeah . Look , you don &apos;t , you don &apos;t talk about like , you know , your girlfriend and the intimate stuff you , you do with her .
Not even with your best friend .
Noo !
That is so sad . Your missing out on so much , Ross . I mean , the bonding and the sharing , you know . And-and knowing that someone else is going through the same thing you are .
Hmph . So what you , you tell each other everything ?
Pretty much .
Did you talk about the night of five times ? Do you tell people about the night of five times ?
Uh , honey , yeah that was with Carol .
I know , but it &apos;s still worth mentioning , I think .
Relax every <unk> in your body . Listen to the <unk> music . Okay , now close you eyes , and think of a happy place . Okay , tell me your happy place .
Richard &apos;s living room , drinking wine .
All right . No , no , no , not a Richard thing , just put down the glass . And get out !
I &apos;m sorry , but that &apos;s my happy place .
Well , okay , fine , use my happy place . Okay , I &apos;m just gonna , I have to ask that you don &apos;t move anything .
All right , I &apos;ll try not to .
Okay , all right , so , your in a meadow , millions of stars in the sky ....
Do you think breaking up with him was a huge mistake ?
All right , there are no questions in the happy place . Okay , just , the warm breeze , and the moonlight <unk> through the trees ....

Okay , this isn &apos;t working . I &apos;m still awake and now I have to pee .
So , I hear , you hate me !
I , ah , I never said hate , I was very careful about that .
A little <unk> told me something about you wanting to rip your arm off and throw it at me .
And you got a &apos; hate &apos; from that ? ! Your taking a big <unk> there ...
All right , fine , fine , fine , fine , fine , We &apos;ve got to do something about our little situation here Joey . So , this is my idea you and me spending some <unk> time together .

Umm , yeah .

Nooo . I had a story all worked out but then Chandler sold me out .
Well , I &apos;m sorry Joe . I didn &apos;t think the doctor was gonna buy that it just * fell * out of the <unk> .
What is this ? Fruit ?
Monica &apos;s making jam .
Whoa , jam ! I love jam ! Hey , how come we never have jam at our place ?
Because the kids need new shoes .
I &apos;m going into business people . I &apos;m sick and tired of being depressed about Richard . I needed a plan , a plan to get over my man . What &apos;s the opposite of man ? Jam . Oh Joey don &apos;t ! It &apos;s way to hot .
This will just be my batch .
Um , that &apos;s it . No . Hey ! You ! <unk> <unk> guy . Yeah . Why have you been following me ? I mean , all week long everywhere I look there &apos;s you .

Oh , that &apos;s great . I &apos;m <unk> the wrong woman . I am such a dingus !
Oh , you &apos;re not a dingus .
I just , I want you to know I didn &apos;t used to be like this . Before I meet your sister I was like this normal guy who sold <unk> and <unk> phones .
Well , I mean look it &apos;s , it &apos;s not your fault , you know . I mean this is just what , what she does to guys , okay .
Well thanks .
Wait , you know what , I got a little story . When I was in <unk> High School I went through this period where I thought I was a witch . And there was this <unk> counselor who said something to me , that I think will help you a lot . He said okay , &apos; you &apos;re not a witch you &apos;re just an average student . &apos; See what I &apos;m saying ?
Not really .
Um , well , get over it . So , I mean you , you just seem to be a really nice guy , you know . Don &apos;t be so hard on yourself okay .

It &apos;s an empty apartment .
Oooh .
We &apos;re all alone in an empty apartment .
Honey , come on , I have to be at work in like ten minutes Oh , all right , well it &apos;s not like I &apos;m <unk> of the year or anything .
There it is .
Oh , oh , that &apos;s what you &apos;re talking about . Hey .
Hey .
Do I look fat ?
Noo .
Okay , I accept that . When Janice asked me and I said no , she took that to mean that I was calling her a cow .
Okay , walk us through it , honey , walk us through it .
Okay , well . Janice said &apos; Hi , do I look fat today ? &apos; And I , I looked at her ....
Whoa , whoa , whoa . You looked at her . You never look . You just answer , it &apos;s just a <unk> . Do I look fat ? Nooo ! Is she <unk> than I am ? Noo ! Does size matter ?
Nooo !
And it works both ways .
Okay , so you both just know this stuff ?
Well you know , after about thirty or <unk> fights , you kinda catch on .
Okay , for instance . Let &apos;s say , Janice is coming back from a trip and she gives you two <unk> . Option number 1 she &apos;ll take a cab home from the airport . Option 2 is you can meet her at baggage claim . Which do you do ?
That &apos;s easy , baggage claim .
Wrong ! Now you &apos;re single . It &apos;s actually secret <unk> number three , you meet her at the gate . That way she knows you love her .
Okay , this is good , this is good . All right listen , I have one . Janice likes to <unk> , at night , which , you know I &apos;m all for . But , uh , you know when you want to go to sleep , you want some space . So , uh , how do I tell her that without , you know , accidentally calling her fat or something .
Oh honey , I &apos;m sorry we can &apos;t help you there , &apos; cause we &apos;re cuddlily sleepers . Okay , I &apos;m late for work .
Oh .
All right are you guys gonna come down ?
Uh , yeah , yeah I &apos;ll , I &apos;m right behind you .
Good luck Chandler .
Thank you Rachel .
Bye sweetie .
Bye hon .
Okay the sleeping thing . Very tricky business , but there is something you can do .
Well , I thought you guys were cuddlily sleepers .
Noo ! No , not cuddlily , not me , just her . I &apos;m like you , I need the room . Okay , come here . Okay , you &apos;re in bed ...
Yeah .
I &apos;m gonna use the cushion .
Yeah .
Okay , you &apos;re in bed . She &apos;s over on your side , <unk> . Now you wait for her to <unk> off , and then you hug her and roll her back over to her side of the bed . And then you <unk> <unk> . Hug for her ! Roll for you .
Okay , the old hug and roll .
Yep .
Okay , one question .

You &apos;re pretending the pillow &apos;s a girl right ?
Remember when you where a kid and your Mom would drop you off at the movies with a jar of jam and a little spoon ?
You &apos;re so pretty .
Hi !
Hey , Phoebe .
Hey , oh , you know that guy who &apos;s been following me ? I talked to him today .
You talked to him . Are you crazy ?
Okay , first I &apos;m not crazy . And second , say it don &apos;t <unk> it . Anyway his name is Malcom , and he wasn &apos;t following me , I mean he was , but &apos; cause he thought I was Ursula , <unk> . And , that &apos;s why , that &apos;s why he couldn &apos;t just come up and talk to me . &apos; Cause of the restraining order .
Umm , not feeling better &apos; bout Malcom .
Ooh ! No , no , no , no , he &apos;s not like a <unk> , no . He &apos;s just like this , this very passionate , incredibly romantic guy , that got like a <unk> bit carried away , you know . And we just get along really well , and he &apos;s so cute .
Oh my God , you &apos;ve got a crush on your sister &apos;s <unk> .
No , I &apos;m just gonna help him , you know , get &apos; <unk> &apos; , like you know , like I did for Joey after he went out with her .

Well , what happened to your jam plan ?
I figured out I need to charge seventeen bucks a jar just to break even . So , I &apos;ve got a new plan now . <unk> .
Well , your gonna need much bigger jars .
What are you talking about ?
I &apos;m talking about me having a baby .
What ?
Are you serious ?
Yeah . The great thing about the jam plan was , I was taking control of my life . So I asked myself , what is the most important thing to me in the world and that &apos;s when I came up with the baby plan .
Well , aren &apos;t you <unk> &apos; something ? What , what , what is uh , what is that guy &apos;s name ? Dad !
It took me 28 years to find one man that I wanna spend my life with , if I have to wait another 28 years then , I &apos;ll be <unk> before I can have a baby , and that &apos;s just stupid .
That , that &apos;s what &apos;s stupid .
I don &apos;t need an actual man , just a couple of his best swimmers . And there , there are places you can go to get that stuff .

Welcome everybody , welcome to Amazing <unk> !
Oh , oh ! It &apos;s on again !
You guys , can we please not watch this all right .
Shhhh !
Folks , has this ever happened to you . You go to the refrigerator to get a nice glass of milk , and these darn cartons are so flingin &apos; -flangin &apos; hard to open .
Oh , you said it Mike . Aw ! There &apos;s got to be a better way !

You &apos;re flingin &apos; -flangin &apos; right I am !
Keep in mind , he &apos;s never used this product before , you &apos;re gonna see how easy this is to do . Go ahead . This works with any milk carton .
Wow , it is easy . Now , I can have milk everyday .
Well , it &apos;s official there are no good movies .
Well , let &apos;s go to a bad one and make out .
Perhaps , you would like me to turn like this , so that you can bunny bump against my back .
Hey !
Hey .
Hey , man . What &apos;s up ?
Maybe you can tell me . My agent would like to know why I didn &apos;t show up at the audition I didn &apos;t know I had today . The first good thing she gets me in weeks . How could you not give me the message ? !
Well , I &apos;ll tell ya I do enjoy guilt , but , ah , it wasn &apos;t me .
Yes , it was ! It was him ! Uh huh ! Okay , it was me !
How is it you ?
Well , it was just , it was all so crazy , you know . I mean , Chandler was in the closet , counting to 10 , and he was up to 7 and I hadn &apos;t found a place to hide yet . I-I-I meant to tell you , and I wrote it all down on my hand . See , all of it .
Yep , that &apos;s my audition .
See , now this is why I keep <unk> everywhere .
Yep , and that &apos;s why we don &apos;t invite you to play .
What is the great <unk> here ? You go get yourself another appointment .
Well , Estelle tried , you know . The casting director told her that I missed my chance .
That is unfair . I &apos;ll call her and tell her it was totally my fault .
Pheebs , you can &apos;t do that . The casting director doesn &apos;t talk to friends , she only talks to agents .
What a sad little life she must lead . Okay , ooh .
What , what are you doing ? What are you doing ?
No , no , no , I know , I know , ooh . &apos; Hi , this is <unk> , from Phoebe Buffay &apos;s office . Um , is um , Ann there for Phoebe , she &apos;ll know what it &apos;s about . &apos;
Hang up , hang up .
<unk> ! Hi . Listen we got a problem with Joey Tribbiani , apparently he missed his audition . Who did you speak to in my office ? Estelle , no , I don &apos;t know what I &apos;m going to do with her . No . All right , so your husband leaves and burns down the apartment , the world does not stop . &apos;
Is anybody else scared ?
<unk> , well look , um , if Joey loses this audition , that is it for Estelle . I don &apos;t care ! Annie you are a doll , what time can you see him ? &apos; I need a pen .
Get the woman a pad ! Get the woman a pad ! A pad ! A pad !
Oh , now you want a pad .
Hey ! !
There &apos;s my boy ! Here &apos;s my boy ! And here &apos;s his Barbi What &apos;s ah , what &apos;s my boy doing with a Barbi ?
He picked it out of the toy store himself , he loves it .
He <unk> it everywhere , it &apos;s like a security blanket , but with ski boots and a <unk> <unk> .
Yeah , it &apos;s , it &apos;s , it &apos;s cute . Why , why , why does he have it , again ?
So he &apos;s got a doll ? So what ? Unless you &apos;re afraid he &apos;s gonna grow up and be in show business .
This doesn &apos;t have anything to do with the fact that he is being raised by two women , does it ?
You know what it &apos;s fine . If you &apos;re okay with the Barbi thing , so am I.
Give daddy the Barbi ! Ben , give , give me the Barbi . Okay , how &apos; bout , don &apos;t you want to play with the monster truck ? No . Okay , oh , oh , how about a <unk> ?
Ross , you are so pathetic . Why can &apos;t your son just play with his doll ?
I gotta go to work . Has anybody seen my left boob ?
I love that movie .
There it is . Joey , what are you doing ?
I &apos;m sorry , it just felt nice .
Joe . Joe ! <unk> the phone .
Hey , I only got one good arm , you know . You should be doing stuff for me . Go get me a sweater .
Just do it ! Okay , it &apos;s Janice and if I get it I &apos;m going to have to see her tonight . Oh , that &apos;s great I &apos;m gonna have to see her tonight .
What &apos;s the big deal ? Why don &apos;t you wanna see Janice ?
Okay , last night at dinner , when the meals came , she put half her chicken piccata on my plate and took my tomatoes .
And that &apos;s bad because ... , you hate chicken piccata ?
Noo .
You didn &apos;t want to share your tomatoes , tomatoes are very important to you .
No , it &apos;s like all of the sudden , we were this couple . And this alarm started going off in my head &apos; Run for your life ! Get out of the building ! &apos;
Men are unbelievable .
What is it with you people ! I mean , the minute you start to feel something , you have to run away ?
I know , that , that &apos;s why I don &apos;t want to go tonight , I &apos;m afraid I &apos;m going to say something stupid .
Oh , you mean like that guy thing where you act mean and <unk> until you get us to break up with you .
Hey , you know about that ? !
Look what do I do ? I wanna get past this , I don &apos;t wanna be afraid of the commitment thing . I wanna go through the tunnel , to the other side !
Where there is no fear of commitment .
Do we have any ... Do we have any thoughts here ?
Well , I &apos;ve never been through the tunnel myself , &apos; cause as I understand it , you &apos;re not allowed to go through with more than one girl in the car , right . But , it seems to me it &apos;s pretty much like anything else , you know , face your fear . It have a fear of <unk> , you go to the top of the building ! If you &apos;re afraid of bugs ..... get a bug . Right . In this case , you have a fear of commitment , so I say you go in there and be the most <unk> guy there ever was .
<unk> , that makes sense .
You think ?
Oh , yeah . Go for it man , jump off the high dive , stare down the barrel of the gun , pee into the wind !

It was really fun , I mean I &apos;ve never talked on a car phone before .
You were amazing , could you just do me this huge favor , you see there &apos;s this one other audition that I really , really want , and Estelle couldn &apos;t get me in .
Oh , I don &apos;t know . I mean it was fun one time .
Come on , please , it &apos;ll be just this one more , well actually it &apos;s two .
Two ?
Yeah ! Well , well really it &apos;s three . Please . You &apos;re so good at it . I love you .
Okay , I &apos;ll do it , but just these three , right
Nooo , four .
So , how come you wanted to eat in tonight ?
&apos;Cause , I wanted to uh , give you this .
Ohhh , are you a puppy ! <unk> paper ! I never really know what to say when someone you &apos;re sleeping with gives you contact paper .
Well , wait there &apos;s , there &apos;s more . See the contact paper is to go into your brand new drawer . See , the drawer actually goes in my dresser .
Oh , you didn &apos;t have to do this .
Yes , I did . Yes , I did . Because , you &apos;re my girlfriend , and that &apos;s what girlfriends should , should get .
Well , I gotta buy a <unk> . Because , oh my <unk> ! Who , would &apos;ve thought that someday , Chandler Bing would buy me a drawer .
Well , not me . But that &apos;s what &apos;s happened , and , ah , and , and there &apos;s more . We should take a trip .
We should ?
Yep , we &apos;re a couple and that &apos;s what couples do . And , I wanna meet your parents . We should take a trip with your parents !
I don &apos;t think we need to , because you &apos;re <unk> me out right now ! Are you okay ?
I am , I actually am . I mean this is amazing . My entire life I have <unk> this place , and now that I &apos;m here it &apos;s like what was the big deal . I could probably say &apos; Let &apos;s move in together . &apos; and I &apos;d be okay .
You probably want us to move in together ?
It doesn &apos;t scare me !
Yeah , well , it scares me ! I mean I not even divorced yet , Chandler . You know , you just invited me over here for pasta , and all of the sudden you &apos;re talking about moving in together . And , and I wasn &apos;t even that hungry . You know what , it &apos;s getting a little late , and I-I should just , um ...
Oh , no , no , no , don &apos;t go ! I &apos;ve scared ya &apos; ! I &apos;ve said too much ! I &apos;m hopeless , and awkward , and desperate for love ! ! Hey , Janice ! It &apos;s me . Um , yeah , I-I-I just wanna apologize in advance for having chased you down the street .
Honey , this will help .
So , I finally catch up to her and she says this relationship is going to fast and we have to slow down .
Uff .
That is never good .
Then I got all needy and clingy .
Okay , wait a minute , wait a minute , wait a minute . Maybe it &apos;s not so bad . How did you leave it ?
She said she &apos;d call me .
Ohh !
Oh God .
Welcome to our side of the tunnel .
This ice cream tastes like crap by the way .
Yeah , well that &apos;s that <unk> , <unk> dairy , <unk> milk junk . We sort of , we save the real stuff for those really terminal cases .
You know , when you start get screwed over all the time , you gotta switch to <unk> .
Yeah , you do .
So , you don &apos;t think I &apos;m terminal ?
Well , no , not at all , you &apos;re not terminal , you just , you just need some damage control .
Okay , okay . So , should I call her ?
Nooo !
This is a very <unk> time right now . If you feel yourself reaching for that phone , then you go shoe shopping , you get your butt in a bubble bath . You want her back you have to start acting aloof .
She has to know that your not ready .
Right . So , what you have to do is , you have to accidentally run into her on purpose . And then act aloof .
So I &apos;m not , not gonna lose her ?
Oooh , honey , you &apos;re not a total loser .
I said , &apos; So I &apos;m not gonna lose her ? &apos;
Oh .
Guess who &apos;s here . It &apos;s the <unk> guy in toy land , Ben . &apos; A real American hero . I &apos;m G.I. Joe ! &apos; Drop the Barbi , drop the Barbi .
G.I. Joe ? Do you really think he &apos;s gonna fall for that ?
G. I. Joe ! Cool ! Can I play ?
Look Ben , it &apos;s a toy that <unk> U.S. oil <unk> <unk> !
Go Joe ! ! !

Pheebs ! There you are !
No it &apos;s not , sorry .
But Phoebe , wait ! Wait ! Phoebe . Phoebe !
Oh , Joey ! Oh , okay , see I didn &apos;t recognize you wearing , in those .... pants .
Look listen , that TV movie I went in for ? Did you hear anything ? I think I got a shot at it .
Yes ! They called and you didn &apos;t get it ! Okay , I mean you didn &apos;t get it , I &apos;m sorry , I &apos;m sorry .
It &apos;s okay , these things happen .
But they shouldn &apos;t happen , you know what , you &apos;re , you &apos;re in a terrible , terrible business . Oh God , I don &apos;t wanna be the person who makes your face look like that .
I &apos;m , I &apos;m okay . See .
Oh , now you &apos;re sad and creepy , oh . You know what , I , I &apos;m sorry I quit , okay , I just quit .
No ! No , no you can &apos;t quit ! You &apos;re the best agent I ever had ! Look Pheebs , rejection is part being an actor , you can &apos;t take it personally .
Not personal , really , well they said that they never met an Italian actor with a worse Italian accent .
They actually said that ?
Yeah . Ooh God , there &apos;s that face again ! See I can &apos;t do this job ! I ...
No , no , no , see that &apos;s why you have to do this job , agents always lie . You know , Estelle just says stuff like &apos; They went another way &apos; , but this , I can use this . I <unk> work on a new accent .
Yeah okay , no if it helps you okay . Yeah .
You &apos;ll never get me , Joe ! ! !
No , thank you . Chandler !
Hello , Janice .
What are you doing here ?
Oh , just a bit of shopping . How &apos;ve you been ?
Are you being British ? !
No . Not anymore .

Well , I &apos;m sorry if my friends aren &apos;t as sophisticated as yours .
Where is this party ?
Here in Chelsea .
Who &apos;s party is it ?
A woman &apos;s
What woman ? !
Chelsea .
Okay , you know , one of two things is happening here . Either you &apos;re seeing somebody behind my back , which would make you the biggest jerk on the planet . Or , else you &apos;re pretending that you &apos;re seeing somebody , which just makes you so pathetic that I could start crying right here in the cereal aisle . So like which of these two guys do you want to be ?
Can I be that guy ?
Okay , so we got some more good <unk> , lots of stuff to work on .
Okay , shoot .
Okay , um , oh , the <unk> commercial .
I didn &apos;t get it ?
No . They said you &apos; Weren &apos;t believable as a human being . &apos; So , you can work on that .
Okay , what else ?
Um , the <unk> play people said &apos; You were pretty but dumb . &apos;
Oh .
Oh no wait , I &apos;m sorry , that &apos;s &apos; pretty dumb . &apos;
Look , it &apos;s okay , no , no , no , really , look um , I really appreciate this Pheebs , but I think I &apos;m gonna have to go back to Estelle .
Oh .
Yeah , well don &apos;t get me wrong , you &apos;re a better agent than she is , but at least with her I don &apos;t want to blow my pretty dumb brains out .
Yeah , no , I understand .
You do , thanks .
Yeah . Sorry .
Wait a minute .
What ?
Wait a minute , did you just make up all that stuff just to get out of being my agent .
Oh , you caught me . I am so busted .
That <unk> what I <unk> .
.... And then I just , you know , threw the bag of barley at her , and ran out of the store .
My God ! Chandler , we said be &apos; aloof &apos; not &apos; a <unk> &apos; .
I &apos;ve actually ruined this haven &apos;t I ? It &apos;s time for the good ice cream now , right ?
Yeah , it is .
You know what , everything &apos;s gonna be okay .
Hello . Hi , Janice ! Can you hold on for a second ? Okay . Okay , what do I do ?
Shhh ... I don &apos;t know what to do , this is totally <unk> .
If-if-if we ever did what you did a man would never call .
Yeah .
Hello !
Oh wait , you know what , I got it , I got it , pretend like you just woke up , okay , that will throw her off . Be sleepy .
Yes , and <unk> .

Well Mr. Big Shot is better than &apos; wethead &apos; .
Okay , some <unk> of the trade . Now , I &apos;ve never been able to cry as an actor , so if I &apos;m in a scene where I have to cry , I cut a hole in my pocket , take a pair of <unk> , and just start pulling . Or ah , or , let &apos;s say I wanna <unk> that I &apos;ve just done something evil . That would be the <unk> &apos; I have a <unk> in my <unk> and I like it &apos; Okay , let &apos;s say I &apos;ve just gotten bad news , well all I do there is try and divide <unk> by 13 . And that &apos;s how it &apos;s done . Great soap opera acting tonight everybody , class <unk> .

Okay , look , Ross , I realise that my Father is difficult , but that &apos;s why you have got to be the bigger man here .
Look sweetie , I could be the bigger man , I could be the biggest man , I could be a big , huge , giant man , and it still wouldn &apos;t make any difference , except that I could pick your Father up and say &apos; Like me ! Like me tiny doctor ! &apos;
Okay , well can &apos;t you just try it one more time Ross ? For me ? For me ?
Rachel one brunch is not gonna solve anything . You gotta face it , okay we &apos;re never gonna get along .

Well , he &apos;s finally <unk> . About that ah , bump on his head ?
Are you , are you , are you sure it &apos;s ah , a new bump ? I mean , no offense , I &apos;ve always thought of Ben as a fairly <unk> <unk> child .

Whenever I would see him I was always think y &apos;know &apos; You &apos;re the reason , you are the reason why their not together . &apos; and I hated that guy . And it didn &apos;t matter how nice he was , or how happy he made my Dad .

Do you remember when you first came here , how you spent two weeks getting <unk> by another waitress ?
Oh , sure ! Do you need me to train somebody new ?
Good one . Actually , ah , Terry wants you to take the training again , whenever .
Eh , do you believe that ?
Yeah ?
So that &apos;s two boxes of the <unk> <unk> . On behalf of the Brown Birds of America , I <unk> you .
Just admit it Chandler , you have no backhand .
Excuse me little one , I have a very solid backhand .

I was shrieking ... like a <unk> .
All right here . Watch me <unk> the three &apos; P &apos;s of <unk> play . Power . <unk> and <unk> .

All right , see you guys .
Look out kids , he &apos;s coming !
And I gotta go sell some Christmas trees .
Have fun . Oh wait , no , don &apos;t ! I forgot I am totally against that now .
What ? Me having a job ?
No , no , I am against innocent trees being cut down in their <unk> , and their , their <unk> <unk> dressed in like <unk> and <unk> lights . Hey , how do you sleep at night ?
Well , I &apos;m pretty tired from <unk> the trees around all day . Hey , Phoebe listen , you got this all wrong . Those trees were born to be Christmas trees , their fulfilling their life purpose , by , by making people happy .
Really ?
Yes . Yes , and ah , ah , the trees are happy too , because for most of them , it &apos;s the only chance to see New York .
... and after you &apos;ve delivered the drinks , you take the empty tray ....
Gunther , Gunther , please , I &apos;ve worked here for two and a half years , I know the empty trays go over there .
What if you put them here .
Huh . Well , y &apos;know that &apos;s actually a really good idea , because that way they &apos;ll be closer to the mugs . Y &apos;know what , you should have the other <unk> do that too .
They already do . That &apos;s why they call it the &apos; tray spot . &apos;
Gee , I always heard them talk about that , I just always thought that it was a club they went to . Oh God , I &apos;m , I &apos;m sorry .
It &apos;s all right . Sweetheart .
So , this must be kinda neat for ya , huh ? I mean , your Dad tells me that you get a couple of days off school , and you , you ah , don &apos;t have to sell those cookies anymore .
Well , I kinda wanted to sell the cookies . The girl who sells the most wins a trip to Spacecamp , and gets to sit in a real space shuttle .
Wow , you ah , you really like all this space stuff , huh ?
Yeah . My Dad says if I spend as much time helping him clean apartments , as I do <unk> about <unk> space , he &apos;d be able to afford a trip to the <unk> <unk> .
I think you would have to clean a whole lot of apartments to go all the way to India .
No . The one in Atlantic City , Dad loves the <unk> . He says he &apos;s gonna double the college money my Grandma left me .
Huh . Well , good luck to Dad . Say , how many more boxes would you have to sell in order to win ?
The girl who won last year sold four hundred and seventy-five .
Yeah .
So far , I &apos;ve sold seventy-five .
Four hundred , huh ? Well , that sounds <unk> . How much are the boxes ?
Five dollars a box .
And what is second prize ?
A ten speed bike . But , I &apos;d rather have something my Dad couldn &apos;t sell .
Well , that makes sense .
Could you do me one favor , if it &apos;s not too much trouble ?
Yeah , Sarah , anything .
Could you pull open the <unk> for me ? The <unk> from the space shuttle are gonna be on the news , and since we don &apos;t have a TV , the lady across the <unk> said she &apos;d push hers up to a window , so I could watch it .
Yesss ?
Hi , I &apos;m selling Brown Bird cookies .
You &apos;re no Brown Bird , I can see you through my peephole .
No , hi , I &apos;m , I &apos;m an <unk> Brown Bird
What does that mean ?
Ah , well , it means that I can sell cookies , but I &apos;m not invited to <unk> .
I can dial 9-1-1 at the touch of a button , y &apos;know . Now , go away !
No , please , please , um , it &apos;s for a poor little girl who wants to go to Spacecamp more than anything in the world .
I &apos;m pressing , a <unk> is on his way .
Okay , okay ! I &apos;m going . I &apos;m going .
I can still see you !
All right ! !
Hey .

Okay . Yikes ! That one doesn &apos;t look very <unk> .

You keep the old ones in the back , that is so <unk> .
Well we have to make room for the fresh ones .
So , what happens to the old guys ?
Well , they go into the chipper .
Why , do I have a feeling that &apos;s not as happy as it sounds ? No ! Nooooo ! ! !
Hey ! Hey ! !
... and these come in the <unk> of your favourite Christmas <unk> , Santa , Rudolph , and Baby Jesus .
All right , I &apos;ll take a box of the cream filled Jesus &apos;s .
Wait a minute , one box ! Come on , I &apos;m trying to send a little girl to Spacecamp , I &apos;m putting you down for five boxes . Chandler , what about you ?
Ahh , do you have any coconut <unk> <unk> ?
No , but ah , there &apos;s coconut in the <unk> <unk> . I tell you what , I &apos;ll put you down for eight boxes , one for each night .
Mon ?
All right , I &apos;ll take one box of the mint treasures , just one , and that &apos;s it . I-I started <unk> weight after I joined the Brown Birds . Remember , how Dad bought all my boxes and I ate them all ?
Ah , no Mon , Dad had to buy everyone of your boxes because you ate them all . But ah , y &apos;know I &apos;m sure that &apos;s not gonna happen this time , why don &apos;t I put you down for three of the mint treasures and just a couple of the Rudolph &apos;s .

Don &apos;t , don &apos;t , don &apos;t , don &apos;t , don &apos;t do this .
I &apos;ll tell you what Mon , I &apos;ll give you the first box for free .
Oh God ! I gotta go !
Come on ! All the cool kids are eating &apos; em !
And when you have a second later , I wanna show you why we don &apos;t just trap <unk> under coffee mugs and leave them there .
I &apos;m training to be better at a job that I hate , my life officially sucks .
Look Rach , wasn &apos;t this supposed to a temporary thing ? I thought you wanted to do fashion stuff ?
Well , yeah ! I &apos;m still pursuing that .
How ... exactly are you pursuing that ? Y &apos;know other than sending out resumes like what , two years ago ?
Well , I &apos;m also sending out .... good thoughts .
If you ask me , as long as you got this job , you &apos;ve got nothing pushing you to get another one . You need the fear .
The fear ?
He &apos;s right , if you quit this job , you then have <unk> to go after a job you really want .
Well then how come you &apos;re still at a job that you hate , I mean why don &apos;t you quit and get &apos; the fear &apos; ?
Because , I &apos;m too afraid .
I don &apos;t know , I mean I would give anything to work for a designer , y &apos;know , or a buyer .... Oh , I just don &apos;t want to be 30 and still work here .
Yeah , that &apos;d be much worse than being 28 , and still working here .
Rachel ?
Yeah .
<unk> me to review with you which pot is decaf and which is regular .
Can &apos;t I just look at the handles on them ?
You would think .
Okay , fine . Gunther , y &apos;know what , I am a terrible waitress , do you know why I &apos;m a terrible waitress ? Because , I don &apos;t care . I don &apos;t care . I don &apos;t care which pot is regular and which pot is decaf , I don &apos;t care where the tray spot is , I just don &apos;t care , this is not what I want to do . So I don &apos;t think I should do it anymore . I &apos;m gonna give you my weeks notice .

The most unbelievable thing happened to me today .
Hi !
Hi ! So I &apos;m out having lunch at Monica &apos;s and this guy starts talking to me , and it turns out he works for a buyer at Bloomingdale &apos;s and there happens to be an opening in his department . So I gave him my phone number and he &apos;s gonna call me this weekend to see if he can get me an interview !

Uh-huh !
And he &apos;s , he &apos;s a total stranger ?
Yeah ! His name is um , Mark something .
Huh . Sounds like Mark Something wants to have some sex .
What ! ?
Well , I &apos;m just saying , I mean why else would he just , y &apos;know , swoop in out of nowhere for no reason .
To be nice .
Hey , Joey . Are men ever nice to strange women for no reason ?
No , only for sex .
Thank you . So did you ah , did you tell Mark Something about me ?
I didn &apos;t have to , because I was wearing my &apos; I heart Ross &apos; sandwich board and ringing my bell .
Uh-huh .

That &apos;s excellent .
So , he &apos;s just a nice guy . You really think this Mark doesn &apos;t want anything in exchange for helping him ?
Well , I assume I &apos;ll have to take showers with him , but y &apos;know , that &apos;s true of any job .
How ya feelin &apos; ?
Well , my apartment isn &apos;t there anymore , because I drank it .

Why , what happened ?
Ah , I fooled around with Joey &apos;s sister . Well , that &apos;s not the worst part .
What is the worse part ?
I can &apos;t remember which sister .
You see what men do ! Don &apos;t tell me men are not nice ! This is men ! !
Are you insane ? I mean Joey , is going to kill you , he &apos;s actually going to kill you dead .
Okay ! You don &apos;t think I thought of that ?

Which one is Gina ?
Dark , big hair , with the airplane earrings .

You see you can &apos;t tell which one is which either , <unk> ! !
We didn &apos;t fool around with any of them . Dwha ! Dwha !
Veronica . Look , it &apos;s got to be Veronica , the girl in the red skirt . I definitely stuck my tongue down her throat .
That was me .
Look , when I &apos;ve been drinking , sometimes I tend to get <unk> friendly , and I &apos;m sorry .
That &apos;s okay .
That &apos;s all right .
That &apos;s okay .
Can I talk to you for a second ? !
Hey , Joey .
Hey .

Why can &apos;t we talk in here ? With , with , witnesses .
I just got off the phone with my sister .
Ah , which , which one ?
Mary-Angela .
Mary-Angela .

Y &apos;know which one was she again ?
Why don &apos;t you ask Chandler , &apos; cause he &apos;s the one that fooled around with her . She told me you said you could really fall for her . Now is that true ? Or are you just gettin &apos; over Janice by <unk> my sister .
It &apos;s gotta be the first one .

Dear Mary-Angela . Hi . How &apos;s it going . This is the hardest letter I &apos;ve ever had to write . What the hell &apos;s a matter with you ? How do you think Joey &apos;s going to react when he finds out that you blew off his sister with a letter ?
Well , that &apos;s the part where you tell him that I moved to France . When actually I &apos;ll be in Cuba .
All right , look , look , you &apos;ve got to do this yourself , okay in person . At least you know her name . You just go to the house and you ask for Mary-Angela , okay , when which ever one she is comes to the door , you take her for a walk , you let her down easy .
What if Mary-Angela comes to the door and I ask for Mary-Angela ?
Where in Cuba ?
Joey , <unk> are you doing here ?

I &apos;m here to see Mary-Angela .

Wait a minute , why don &apos;t you just call Mark . I mean , who says you have to sit here and wait for him , you &apos;ve got to make stuff happen .

Well , that is usually what I would do . But I just never thought you &apos;d be on the <unk> end of it . How could you do this ? !
Joey if you wanna punch me , go ahead , I deserve it . But I just want you to know that I would never <unk> hurt you or your family , you &apos;re my best friend . I would never do anything like this ever again .
So what . I say , punch him .
Yeah ! Punch him ! Punch him !
No ! No ! No ! No , I &apos;m not going to punch Chandler .

And y &apos;know what , I get excited about stupid stuff , like when I my People magazine comes on Saturday , and the new Hold Everything catalog . Y &apos;know but that does not mean that I &apos;m empty , I care about things . I care about my friends and family . You have no right to make that kind of judgment about me .
Whoa , whoa , whoa .
You don &apos;t even know me ...
Whoa , whoa , whoa , the poem is not about you .
What ?
The Empty Vase is not about you . My baby , you make me so sad that you would think this .
I &apos;m sorry , my friend Phoebe ...

So , are you gonna see him again ?
Tomorrow night .

It &apos;s not a date , okay . I &apos;m just gonna teach him how to make lasagne for some pot luck dinner he has .
Well , you might wanna make a little extra , y &apos;know you &apos;ll probably be hungry after the sex .
We &apos;re not gonna have sex ! Okay , nothing &apos;s changed here . He still doesn &apos;t want children and I still do , so that &apos;s why we &apos;re just gonna be friends .
Naked friends .
Hey .
Hey .
Do you have any ice ?
Check the freezer . If there &apos;s none in there , then we &apos;re probably out . Are you just getting in from work ? It &apos;s late .
Yeah , I know . I had the greatest day though , I got to sit in on the meeting with the <unk> from Calvin <unk> . I told my boss I liked this line of lingerie , she ordered a ton of it . How was your day ?
I discovered I &apos;m able to count all of my teeth using just my tongue .
Hmm . Umm , why do you have a copy of The Shining in your freezer ?
Oh , I was reading it last night , and I got scared , so .
But ah , you &apos;re safe from it if it &apos;s in the freezer ?
Well , <unk> . Y &apos;know , I mean I never start reading The Shining , without making sure we &apos;ve got plenty of room in the freezer , y &apos;know .
How often do you read it ?
Haven &apos;t you ever read the same book over and over again ?
Well , umm , I guess I read Little Women more than once . But I mean that &apos;s a classic , what &apos;s so great about The Shining ?
The question should be Rach , what is not so great about the shining . Okay ? And the answer would be nothing . All right ? This is like the scariest book ever . I bet it &apos;s way better than that classic of yours .
Okay . Ah , well we &apos;ll just see about that , okay . I will read The Shining , and you will read Little Women .
All right , you got it .
All right .
Okay .
Okay .
Ah , now Rach , these ah , these little women .

So when people complement me on my cooking should I , what do I say ?
You say &apos; Thank you very much , &apos; and then you buy me something pretty . Come on , we &apos;re gonna put are hands in this bowl , and we &apos;re gonna start squishing the tomatoes .

Oops .

No wonder Rachel had to read this so many times .

You mean like exclusive friends ?
Why not ? ! I mean this has been the most amazing week . Would it be so terrible ? Even if we were friends who lived together . Or , maybe someday friends who stood up in front of their other friends , and <unk> to be friends forever .
Wow . Y &apos;know we &apos;re back where we were . Honey , I would love to do all that , but nothing &apos;s changed .
That &apos;s not true , you don &apos;t have a moustache .
Okay , okay , one thing &apos;s changed . But we still want different things and we know how this is gonna end .
Y &apos;know what , I &apos;ve got to walk out of here right now , &apos; cause getting over you is the hardest thing that I have ever had to do . I don &apos;t think I could do it again .

No , umm , he met some girl at the coffee house .
Oooh .
Yeah , Ginger something .
Nooo . No , no , ah , are you sure it wasn &apos;t something that sounded like Ginger , like ah , <unk> ?
No , it was Ginger . I remember , because when he told me , I said , &apos; the movie star . &apos;
Aww , man . That &apos;s the girl I was hiding from . When she finds out he &apos;s my roommate , she &apos;s gonna tell him what I did .
Well , what did you do ?
What , oh , oh , oh , no , no , I can &apos;t , I can &apos;t tell you that , it &apos;s like the most awful , horrible thing I &apos;ve ever done my whole life .
Y &apos;know what , don &apos;t tell us . We &apos;ll just wait until Chandler gets home , because it &apos;ll be more fun that way .
All right ! ! Okay , it was like four years ago . Okay , Ginger and I had gone out a few times , and then this one weekend , we went up to her Dad &apos;s cabin . Just me , her , and her annoying little dog Pepper . Well that night , I cooked this really romantic dinner ....
You gave her food poisoning ! ?
I wish . No . After dinner , me , her , and Pepper all fell asleep in front of the fire . Well I woke up in the middle of the night and I saw that the fire was dying out . So , I picked up a log and threw it on . Or , at least what I thought was a log .
Oh my God ! ! You threw Pepper on the fire !
I wish . See , I guess another thing I probably should &apos;ve told you about Ginger is that she kinda has a ah , <unk> leg .
Oh my God ! Joey , what did you do after you threw her leg on the fire ?
I ran ! !
Well , that &apos;s the best kiss I &apos;ve had with anyone I &apos;ve ever met in a men &apos;s room .
Actually , me too .
Op , foot in a puddle , foot all in a puddle .
Oh damn , I hate that .

Hello ! <unk> <unk> recently discovered in the <unk> of the rain forest !
They have the best stuff in there .
Oh my God ! Oh my God !

You think ? ! God , I , ah , I &apos;m in hell . I mean what , what am I gonna do ? Rachel &apos;s all like , &apos; I love you and , and let &apos;s work on this . &apos; And all I can think about is , &apos; What is she gonna do ? What is she gonna say ? &apos; when I tell her what I did .
Well , before we answer that , I think we should address the more important question . How dumb are you ?
What ? ! Look , we &apos;re trying to rebuild a relationship here , right . How am I supposed to do that here , without being totally honest with each other ?
Look , Ross look , I &apos;m on board about this totally honesty thing , I am , just not about stuff that &apos;s gonna get you in trouble .
He &apos;s right . Nobody &apos;s gonna benefit , and you &apos;re just gonna hurt her .
Yeah , and there won &apos;t be a relationship left to rebuild .
Yeah , but don &apos;t you think ....
All right look , if you absolutely have to tell her , at least wait until the timing &apos;s right . And that &apos;s what <unk> are for .
Yeah , okay .
All right , okay , now , we just have to make sure she doesn &apos;t find out some other way . Did you think about the trail ?
What trail ?
The trail from the woman you did it with to the woman you hope never finds out who did it ! You always have to think about the trail !
Oh , I-I don &apos;t think there &apos;s any trail .
Okay , okay-okay , ah , Chloe works with that guy Issac . Issac &apos;s sister is Jasmine . And Jasmine works at that message place with Phoebe . And Phoebe &apos;s friends with Rachel . And that &apos;s the trail , I did it !
After <unk> the Waxine and linen strips to leg number one ,
Did that !
<unk> one of the linen strips by its &apos; easy grab tab &apos; and pull it off in one quick pain free motion .
Okay . Ow ! ! ! ! ! <unk> !
Was it not <unk> ?
No . It was painful . Oh my God , they should call it <unk> , now with a little wax .
Huh , well , the girls in the satin <unk> on the commercial don &apos;t seem to think it &apos;s that bad .
That &apos;s because their <unk> are probably <unk> from being so stupid . But hey , y &apos;know if you don &apos;t believe me , please , by my guest .
Ow-ow-ow-ow ! Oh my God ! ! !

Oh no . I feel it isn &apos;t really anybody &apos;s business , y &apos;know .
Exactly . So you didn &apos;t , didn &apos;t mention anything to Issac right ?
Oh , well I tell Issac everything .
You tell , of course you do . Issac . Issac . Hey , Issac . Issac , hi ! Y &apos;know we haven &apos;t actually met ...

Oh right , that Rachel chick from the coffee place .

For your information , this happens to be a pain like no man will ever experience .
Yeah , well I don &apos;t think you can make that statement , unless you &apos;ve been kicked in an area that God only meant to be treated nicely .
Yeah , I-I think that women just have a lower <unk> of pain than men , that &apos;s all . I mean , come on , it &apos;s just a little wax .
Oh yeah , come here .
Oh , that &apos;s mature .
Okay , fine , so now what , I just pull it off ?

I &apos;m sorry , okay , I &apos;m sorry . I <unk> was <unk> with myself , and this morning I was so , I was so upset and then I got your message and I was so happy , and all I wanted was to get her out of my apartment as fast as possible .
Whoa ! ! Whoa , whoa , wait a minute . What time did your little friend leave ? Oh my God . She was there ? She was still there ? She was in there , when I was in there ? !
Listen . Oh hey , hey , the important thing was that she meant , she meant nothing to me !
And yet she was worth <unk> our relationship ! !
Look , I didn &apos;t think there was a relationship to <unk> . I thought we were broken up .
We were on a break !
That , for all I knew would , could last forever . That to me is a break-up .
You think you &apos;re gonna get out of this on a <unk> ?
Look , I &apos;m not trying to get out of anything , okay . I thought our relationship was dead !
Well , you sure had a hell of a time at the wake !
Y &apos;know what , I don &apos;t think we should listen to this anymore .
What , what are you doing ? You can &apos;t go out there .
Why not ? ! I &apos;m hungry .
Because they &apos;ll know we &apos;ve been listening .
God ! And to have to hear about it from Gunther ! !
Come on ! Like I wanted him to tell you , I ran all over the place trying to make sure that didn &apos;t happen !
Oh , that is so sweet . I think I &apos;m falling in love with you all over again .
Y &apos;know what , I think we can go out there . I mean they have more important things to worry about .
Yeah , we &apos;ll be fine .
Look Rachel , I wanted to tell you , I thought I should , I-I did , and then Chandler and Joey convinced me not to .
<unk> the door shut , we &apos;re never leaving , ever .
Hi , it &apos;s Phoebe . Listen someone &apos;s gonna have to take my 9 : 00 with Mr. <unk> , &apos; cause it &apos;s like 9 : 15 now , and I &apos;m not there .
Don &apos;t you realise none of this would &apos;ve ever happened if I didn &apos;t think at that same moment you weren &apos;t having sex with Mark ?
All right . Let &apos;s say I had slept with Mark . Would you have been able to forgive me ?
Yes I would .
You &apos;d be okay if you knew that Mark had kissed me , and been naked with me , and made love to me ?
Yes .
You knew that our hot , sweaty , <unk> bodies were ....

Oh man , pizza ? I like pizza . Put olives on the pizza .
We could eat the wax ! It &apos;s <unk> .
Oh great , food with hair on it .

Because that would be crazy ?
Hey , can I , can I get in on that ? Because I &apos;m kinda hungry myself .
Fine . Hi ! Yes , I &apos;d like to order a large pizza .
No anchovies .
With ah , extra anchovies .
That &apos;s okay , I &apos;ll just pick &apos; em off .
Yeah , and could you please chop some up and just put it right there in the sauce ?
You can have the last piece , if you want .
Well , I should think so . You slept with someone .
They &apos;re gonna get through this , aren &apos;t they ?
Yeah , come on , it &apos;s Ross and Rachel , they &apos;ve got too .

You think I need a new walk ?

Are you actually saying these words ?
What , now you &apos;re not even taking to me ? Look Rachel , I-I &apos;m sorry , okay , I &apos;m sorry , I was out of my mind . I thought I &apos;d lost you , I didn &apos;t know what to do .

<unk> ! Yeah , okay .
Hey . It &apos;s three in the morning . They don &apos;t know that I &apos;ve come home yet . You notice how neither one of them are wondering where I am .

Y &apos;know what , y &apos;know what , I &apos;m-I &apos;m not the one that wanted that , that break , okay . You &apos;re the one that <unk> on us . You &apos;re the one that , that ran when things got just a little rough !

Okay , well here we are . Now we &apos;re in a tough spot again , Rach . What do you want to do ? How do you want to handle it ? Huh ? Do you wanna fight for us ? Or , do you wanna <unk> ? Look , I , I did a terrible , stupid , stupid thing . Okay ? And I &apos;m sorry , I wish I could take it back , but I can &apos;t . I just can &apos;t see us throwing away something we know is so damn good . Rachel , I love you so much .
No Ross ! ! Don &apos;t ! You can &apos;t just kiss me and think you &apos;re gonna make it all go away , okay ? It doesn &apos;t work that way . It doesn &apos;t just make it better . Okay ?
Okay , okay , okay .
I think you should go .
What ?
I really think you need to go now .
Okay , okay . This morning you said there was nothing so big that we couldn &apos;t work past it together ...
Yeah , what the hell did I know !
Look , look , there &apos;s got to be a way we can work past this . Okay , I can &apos;t imagine , I can &apos;t imagine my life without you . Without , without these arms , and your face , and this heart . Your good heart Rach , and , and ....
No . I can &apos;t , you &apos;re a totally different person to me now . I used to think of you as somebody that would never , ever hurt me , ever . God , and now I just can &apos;t stop <unk> with her , I can &apos;t , it doesn &apos;t matter what you say , or what you do , Ross . It &apos;s just changed , everything . Forever .
Yeah , but this can &apos;t be it , I mean .
Then how come it is ?
They &apos;ve been quiet for a long time .
Maybe she killed him ?
Let &apos;s go .
Is that your new walk ?
No , I really have to pee .
Can I see the comics ?
This is the New York Times .
Okay , may I see the comics ?
Guys . I thought you were taking Ross to the game ?
We are . He &apos;s meeting us here .

Yeah , you shoulda been there last night .
Why ? What happened now ?
Well Ross was hangin &apos; out over at our place , Rachel comes over to borrow some moisturiser from Chandler ....
Yeah <unk> , how hard is it to say something ? Rachel came over to borrow something .
Anyway ! Her and Ross just started yelling at each other .
Wait . Why was he yelling at her ? He &apos;s the one who slept with someone else .
Well , I guess he says that because they were on a break when it happened , that she should of forgiven him by now .
Whoa ! ! He is soo unreasonable ! God , although I think I understand what he means . Oh my God , this is like 60 Minutes , okay , when , when , at first you &apos;re really mad at that <unk> company for making the drug and then y &apos;know you just feel bad for the people because they needed to make their hair grow .
Y &apos;know what this is like ? This is like when my parents got divorced . Man , I hope Ross doesn &apos;t try to <unk> me after <unk> Scouts .
Y &apos;know I had a dream where Ross and Rachel were still together , they never broke up . And we were all just like hanging out , and everyone was happy ....
I had the same dream !
Yeah , and nobody slept with that Xerox girl .
Oh , I had the opposite dream .
Y &apos;know what maybe it &apos;s gonna be okay , I mean it &apos;s been a week .
Yeah , I mean it &apos;s never taken me a week to get over a relationship .
It &apos;s never taken you more than a shower to get over a relationship .
Okay , let &apos;s go ! ! Let &apos;s hit the road ! !

Ah ! Oh .

I don &apos;t know , I &apos;m sorry , I always slept in the back when we drove up here .
Okay . Hey , can you send somebody up and down 76 and check every rest stop , and , and also 93 ? Okay ! Yeah , no they don &apos;t do that .
Ugh , okay , well somebody will come and save us .
Who ? I mean have you seen a car come by here in the last hour and a half ? I think we should call Ross , maybe he can get a car and come pick us up .
No ! No , I am not getting in a car with Ross , we will just have to live here !
But if ...
No you guys , I am not getting in a car with him , you &apos;ll have to think of something else .
Oh good , oh Joey and Chandler are back .
So the going for help went well ?
Oh yeah , Smokey Joe here got half way to the <unk> and <unk> .

No , I &apos;m not gonna pick them up .
Listen , we both know you &apos;re gonna do it &apos; cause you &apos;re not a jerk . Okay ? So you can either sulk here for a half hour and then go pick them up , or save us both time and sulk in the car .
No , Rachel doesn &apos;t want me to ....
Look , I-I-I am sorry that Rachel dumped you &apos; cause she fell in love with that Mark guy , and you are the innocent victim in all of this , but don &apos;t <unk> your friends for what Rachel did to you .

Yeah , <unk> charming isn &apos;t &apos; it ? Well listen let &apos;s , you wanna get something to eat ? &apos; Cause this place is kinda depressing .
And the man who made all this possible ... Mr. Peter Becker .
One second .
I don &apos;t think this town is big enough for both of us to relax in . <unk> ! !

Wow , you &apos;re really crazy about her , huh ?
Oh , you have no idea . And-and when we &apos;re on stage I get to-to kiss her and-and touch her , but then she goes home with the director , and it &apos;s like somebody &apos;s ripping out my heart !

That &apos;s a dog , every house should have a dog .
Not one that can pee on the roof .
Well , maybe it &apos;s so big because the house was built on radioactive waste .
And is this in case the house <unk> ?
No , no , that &apos;s the ghost for the <unk> .
I don &apos;t want a ghost .
Well , nobody wants a ghost . But you &apos;ve got one , because the house is sitting on an ancient Indian burial ground .
Wait a minute , the house was built on radioactive waste , and an ancient Indian burial ground ? That would never happen .
Okay , obviously you don &apos;t know much about the U.S. government .
Hey !
Hello .

Well , the movie was great , dinner was great , and there &apos;s nothing like a cool , <unk> New York evening .

Of course , I didn &apos;t get to enjoy any of that , because Joanna &apos;s such a big , dull <unk> !
Chandler is fantastic ! !

Oh God , we just <unk> ! Y &apos;know how people just click ? Like he came by to pick me up , and I opened the door , and it was just like , click ! Did he tell you ?

Oh , I know ...
Oh , I know and he &apos;s soo sweet ! Listen , he said he was going to call , so put him straight through .
Isn &apos;t this great ? !
Don &apos;t spoil it .
Come on baby , don &apos;t go . Please ? What do you say ?
Hello . Oh ! It &apos;s you . Just ah , just one-one sec . I am going to take this call . When I continue , I hope that there will appear on stage this magical thing that in the theatre we call , <unk> to the moment !
That guy &apos;s like a cartoon . What do you see in him anyway ?
He happens to be brilliant . Which is more than I can say for that sweater you &apos;re dating .
Hey , I &apos;m not interested in her sweater ! It &apos;s what &apos;s underneath her sweater that counts . And besides , since ah , since when do you care who I &apos;m going out with ?
I don &apos;t care . Why , do you want me to care ?
Do you want me to want you to care ?
Do you ?
What ?
Okay , I &apos;m afraid to say this , but let &apos;s pick it up where we left off .
Come on baby , don &apos;t go . Please ? What do you say ?
I &apos;ve got no reason to stay .
Stop ! ! Stop it ! You must stop ! You are bad actors ! This is a terrible play ! I &apos;ll see you in the morning .
I can &apos;t believe we go on in , in a week .
Hey , it &apos;s gonna be all right .
Hey ! So since we &apos;re getting off early , do you want to go and paint mugs ?
What ?
You know ! At the place I told you about last night ?
Oh , yeah , with the mug painting . Yeah . I was so listening to that . But ah , y &apos;know what , I think I kinda need to work on my stuff tonight .
Oh , okay .
Okay .
I &apos;ll see you tomorrow .
Okay .
G &apos;night .
Ah , are you okay ?
Yeah , I guess . Look , what are we gonna do about this scene , huh ?
I don &apos;t know .
Well umm , maybe if it had more heat .
How do you mean ?
Well , Adrian &apos;s looking for a reason to stay , right ? Victor can &apos;t just kiss her , he &apos;s gotta , gotta really give her a reason , y &apos;know ?
Maybe he could slip her the tongue .
Or maybe , maybe he could grab her , and , and , and , and lift her up .
Yeah , yeah , and then Adrian , she maybe she could wrap her legs around his waist .
And then she could rip off his shirt and kiss his chest , and , and his stomach !
And then , then he could use his teeth , his teeth to undo her dress , and , and , and bite her !
And then right , right when the scene ends , he could take her with this raw , animal ....
Something like that ?
Yeah , that &apos;s pretty much what I had in mind .
Yeah .
Hey .
Hi .
Hey .
Hi .
Hey .
It &apos;s a little early to be drinkin &apos; .
No-no , things ah , finally happened with Kate .
Ohhhhh !
You &apos;re kidding ? ! That &apos;s great !
Oh , it was so amazing . After the love making ...
Oh my .
Yep . I just , I just watched her sleep for like hours , just breathing in and breathing out . And then I knew she was <unk> &apos; cause , &apos; cause her eyes keep going like this .
I &apos;m telling ya , Joanna &apos;s got it all wrong . Okay ? All I said was , &apos; This was fun . Let &apos;s do it again sometime . I &apos;ll give you a call . &apos;
Ohh , <unk> . I wonder why she thinks you &apos;re going to call her ?
That &apos;s what you say at the end of a date .
You can &apos;t just say , &apos; Nice to meet you , good night ? &apos;
To her face ? Look it &apos;s the end of the date , I &apos;m standing there , I know all she &apos;s waiting for is for me to say &apos; I &apos;ll call her &apos; and it &apos;s just y &apos;know , comes out . I can &apos;t help it , it &apos;s a <unk> .
Come on Rach , when a guy says he &apos;s going to call , it doesn &apos;t mean he &apos;s going to call . <unk> &apos;t it ever happened to you ?
Well , they always called .
Hmm , bite me .
Did he call ?
No . Sorry .
Why ? ! Why ? ! He said he &apos;d call . Why hasn &apos;t he called ?
Maybe he &apos;s <unk> by really smart , strong , successful women .
Sophie , would you please climb out of my butt . Why hasn &apos;t he called , Rachel ? Why ?
Okay , okay . Umm , well ah , maybe he , maybe he feels awkward because you are my boss .
<unk> ? Why should he feel awkward ?
Well ...
The only person that should feel awkward is you , and you didn &apos;t tell him not to call me , did you ?
No . I ...
Because if you feel uncomfortable with your friend dating someone you work for , there are always ways to fix ... that .
Call her ! Call her now !
<unk> , so many paper cuts .
Why hasn &apos;t he called Rachel ? Why ? Why ? I don &apos;t understand . Why ? He said he &apos;ll call . Why ? Why ? Chandler I &apos;m telling you she has flipped out , she &apos;s gone crazy !
Oh , well give me the phone then .
Come on , this isn &apos;t funny . She thinks it &apos;s my fault that you haven &apos;t called her . You have to call her !
Look , you can &apos;t call somebody after this long just to say , &apos; In case you didn &apos;t notice , I don &apos;t like you ! &apos;
Well then you &apos;re going to have to take her out again .
Nooo ! ! She &apos;s really dull ! And she gets this gross mascara goop thing in the corner of her eye !
I don &apos;t care ! I don &apos;t care ! You are going to have to take her out again and end it , and end it in way that she knows it &apos;s actually ended . And , I don &apos;t care how hard it is for you , do not tell her that you will call her again !
All right ! Fine ! But it &apos;s just a lunch date , no more than an hour ! And from now on I get my own dates , I don &apos;t want you setting me up with anybody ever again !
That &apos;s fine !
That &apos;s just a lot of big talk , y &apos;know .

Look umm , I , I was , I was just caught up in the moment . That &apos;s all it was . Joey , I &apos;m-I &apos;m sorry you feel bad , but haven &apos;t you ever sleep with a women where it meant more to her than it did to you ?

And this isn &apos;t Rachel &apos;s fault . It &apos;s me . I have serious , serious problems when it comes to women . I have issues with commitment , <unk> , mascara goop . And I &apos;m really sorry , it &apos;s just that this is not , this isn &apos;t going to work out .

Yeah , <unk> .
So ...

Why , does she have a bad personality ?
Oh no , Bonnie &apos;s the best !

Well , you &apos;re not gonna get going are you ?
Well let me ask you a question . Am I the Ultimate Fighting Champion ?
Well , no . But ...
Well I &apos;m not gonna stop until I &apos;m the Ultimate Fighting Champion .
That guy stood on your neck until you passed out !
Let me tell you a story . When I set out to create Moss 865 , do you think it just happened <unk> ? No . There was Moss 1 , that <unk> down my Dad &apos;s garage , there was Moss 2 that would only schedule appointments in January , and <unk> others that I learned from , just like I learned from this fight , never to let a guy stand on my neck .
You didn &apos;t know that already ?
Look , I &apos;m gonna get better . Okay ? I promise you .
Okay , just get a lot better . <unk> .
Oh , one other thing . Hoshi thinks that you being <unk> may have <unk> my <unk> .
Yeah . That-that was the problem .
Hey .
Hey ! How long until Pete &apos;s fight ?
Oh , about five minutes . Right now they &apos;re interviewing his opponent . Apparently he trains by going to <unk> and pulling the arms off <unk> .
Hot dog ?
Four , please . I &apos;m really nervous . Thank you .
So Ross , how umm , how did it go with Bonnie ?
What ? Oh ! I gotta tell you , I-I wasn &apos;t expecting to like her at all , I mean I actually wasn &apos;t expecting to like anyone right now , but she &apos;s really terrific .
Ohh , that &apos;s too bad !
No , I-I &apos;m saying I liked her .
Yeah , y &apos;know what , there are other fish in the sea .
Pheebs , I think she &apos;s great . Okay ? We &apos;re going out again .

Excuse me , Doug ? Hey there sports fan ! !
Bing ! You got those numbers for me ?
No , I ah , I didn &apos;t do them .
Oh , you forgot ?

Well , I got <unk> myself last night . Pretty <unk> drive home , <unk> <unk> never looked smaller . That &apos;s okay , you &apos;re still my number one guy ! Bing !
Doug ! !
Hmm .
I &apos;m a little bit uncomfortable with the that way you <unk> yourself .
Oh , is it the swearing ? I mean is it the constant swearing ? Because I gotta tell ya , if it is , you can just ... kiss my ass !
No , no . It-it &apos;s not about the swearing , it &apos;s more about ah , the way , that you ah , <unk> , concentrate , your <unk> on my buttock .
Oh ?
Oh , and don &apos;t get me wrong , I appreciate the <unk> . It &apos;s just that I , I have a rather , sensitive <unk> , and ah , besides , it &apos;s making all the other guys jealous .
Well , say no more . Y &apos;know it takes guts to bring this up . Bing ! You &apos;re okay .
Okay .
Ha ! <unk> !
Ahhhhh !
Okay . Would you rather live in the shirt pocket of a sweaty giant , or inside his shower drain ?
Oh my God ! Phoebe look , it &apos;s Ross and that girl .
No ! No ! Look at that ! It &apos;s a line of <unk> ! They &apos;re working as a team !
Phoebe !
Right , oh yeah . Wow , oh , it looks like Ross is breaking up with her . Uff , I hope he lets her down easy . Let &apos;s go .
Come on Phoebe , look at that ! They are not breaking up , look at them . Okay that &apos;s , you know what that is ? That is a , that is a second date , that &apos;s what that is ! Look at that , she just put her hand on his <unk> ...
Oh no ! That really is nothing , she is very sexually <unk> .
Ohh ! Phoebe , this is all your fault ! Now he loves her , he &apos;s gonna marry her , and this is all your fault .
You said it was okay !

What ? ! <unk> ? ! !
Phoebe , we can &apos;t , we just can &apos;t just let it happen ! Okay , we have to do something ! We have to break them up ! Okay ? Just go in there and like , shave her head ! You owe me one bald girl ! !
Okay , first of all , breathe . Second of all , I don &apos;t get it . Aren &apos;t you the one that decided that you didn &apos;t want to be with Ross ?
Yes .
Well isn &apos;t he your friend ? Don &apos;t you want him to be happy ?

You are insane ! You-you gotta give this up !
I can &apos;t until I &apos;m the ultimate fighter . I will do it . I &apos;m telling you , the day will come when children will argue over who will win a fight , me or Superman . Now , I &apos;m not saying I could beat Superman , but y &apos;know , kids are stupid .
Sit down . All right ? Please , just listen to me . You are terrible at this ! Okay ? You are the worst ultimate fighter ever ! Ever ! !
Y &apos;know I have a torn <unk> <unk> , a <unk> <unk> in my right <unk> , and a <unk> <unk> Adam &apos;s <unk> , but that really hurt .
Well then , y &apos;know what ? I care about you to much to watch you hurt yourself like this . So if you have to do this , then you &apos;re gonna have to do it without me .
Well if you &apos;re asking me to quit , then you &apos;re asking me to be someone I &apos;m not . I &apos;ve got to do this .
Then I &apos;ve gotta go . Bye .

Yes ?
Could you leave a note ? &apos; Cause I &apos;m on a lot of pain <unk> now , and I don &apos;t know if I &apos;ll remember this tomorrow .

Uh-oh , Bruiser has Becker on the canvas and is going for his favourite area .
Oh ! Oh !
Wait , if that &apos;s his favourite area , why is he being so mean to it ?

Apparently she fell in the shower and hit her head .

Look , <unk> , it &apos;s gonna be okay .
That &apos;s easy for you to say , I don &apos;t see three kids coming out your <unk> !

Monica ? You gonna be very proud of me . I just got us dates with two unbelievably cute nurses .
Oh my !

Not in my head .
Anyway , they want to take us out Saturday night ! What do you say ?
Umm . Umm . Umm . I don &apos;t think so .
What ? What are you talking about ? ! You-you &apos;re the one who &apos;s been telling me to get over Ross and move on . I &apos;m moving on , and you &apos;re moving on with me . Come on , give me one good reason why you don &apos;t wanna go .
Umm , why don &apos;t you give me something that would be a good reason and-and then I &apos;ll tell you if it &apos;s true .

Okay , you &apos;re coming with me , and I also told them that if we &apos;re still here when they get off that we &apos;ll go down to the <unk> and have some Jell-O with them .
Yep ! There &apos;s always room for Jell-O ...
Joey , how do you make that dirty ?
Oh , it &apos;s easy . Yeah , I-I can do it with anything . Watch uh , Grandma &apos;s chicken salad ...

Yeah , I was bummed too .
So they &apos;re going on dates ? When ?

Okay !
Hey .
Let &apos;s see what we got here . Ohh , y &apos;know , Fonzie dated triplets .
This-this Fonzie person you keep referring too , is that uh , is that another doctor ?
Oh no-no-no . Fonzie is the nickname of <unk> <unk> . The Fonz .
All right .
It &apos;s not that weird , is it ?
It &apos;s very weird ! I don &apos;t want some guy down there telling me , I &apos;m y &apos;know , <unk> !
To be fair , he doesn &apos;t seem to be impersonating Fonzie ...
What are you doing ? ! ! Why are you <unk> him ? ! Just get me another doctor ! One who is not crazy and who is not Fonzie !
Again , it &apos;s not that he ...
<unk> ! There you are !
Umm , listen there &apos;s something I think you should know .
Oh , is this about you-you dating the nurse ? Yeah , Joey already told me , and I am so-so fine . I mean , you and I we &apos;re just , y &apos;know , we &apos;re nothing , we &apos;re <unk> &apos; around .
Umm , actually I was about to tell you that I was , I was going to get out of it , but hey , if we &apos;re just goofing around then uh , maybe I will go out with him .
Fine ! Maybe I will too !
Hey , you guys ! Look what I found in the <unk> shop . Get up ! Get up ! Get up !
Okay , Phoebe , this Dr. <unk> . He has no strong feelings about Fonzie or any of the Happy Days gang .
Hi ! And you &apos;re going into what grade ?
Umm , I &apos;m actually a first year <unk> , but I get that a lot , you see , I-I graduated early ...
Uh-huh , me too . Ross , maybe I should &apos;ve <unk> that I &apos;d be needing a grown up doctor .
Oh no , I &apos;m fully qualified to ...
Shh ! <unk> , shh ! Doesn &apos;t anybody understand that I &apos;m gonna be having babies soon ? Huh ? Go ! Go little boy , go !
Oh cool ! You made him cry !
Mr. Tribbiani , I &apos;m afraid you &apos;ve got kidney stones .
Umm , well , what else could it be ?
It &apos;s kidney stones .
Or ?
Kidney stones !
All right , you &apos;re getting there . Oh , and y &apos;know , these babies are very , very lucky .
They are . Why ?
They have the honor of being born on The Fonz &apos;s <unk> .
Happy birthday !
Just-just to <unk> , I &apos;m not Fonzie .
Honey , y &apos;know I just gotta tell you , I think this is such a terrific thing you &apos;re having these babies for Frank and Alice .
I know , it is .
Yeah !
Can I tell you a little secret ?
Yeah !
I want to keep one .
Ohh , I &apos;m gonna be on the news !
Okay , Phoebe , honey , you gotta be kidding . I mean , you know you cannot keep one of these babies !
Why not ? ! Maybe I can , you don &apos;t know !
Yes ! Yes ! Yes , I do ! I do know ! Frank and Alice are gonna want to keep all of their children !
Maybe not ! Y &apos;know ? Seriously , three babies are a handful maybe they &apos;re y &apos;know , looking for a chance to <unk> one of them . Listen , I-I hate to miss an opportunity just because I didn &apos;t ask ! Y &apos;know ?
Phoebe , no ! This is , this is insane .
Oh , just ask him !
Me ? !
I can &apos;t ask him ! Do you have any idea how inappropriate that would be ? ! All I &apos;m saying is just talk to Frank . Okay ? Just , y &apos;know , feel him out !
No ! Forget it ! I am not gonna ask Frank to give you one of his kids ! !
You &apos;re right .
Tell him it &apos;s for you .
<unk> a little better sweetie ?
Well , maybe a little . I wish you hadn &apos;t seen me throw up .
Me too .
Hey ! I just heard . What &apos;s up ?
Kidney stones ! Now , ordinarily Mr. Tribbiani , we try to break up the stones up with <unk> waves , but they &apos;re to close to the bladder now . Which means we can either wait for you to pass them or else go up the urethra ...
Whoa-whoa ! No-no-no-no-no , nothing is going up ! Okay ? Up , up is not an <unk> &apos;s a urethra ? Are you crazy ? !
So did you ask him ?
No , I haven &apos;t had a chance to be alone with him yet .
Well , I &apos;m kinda on a clock here .
Oh Fonzie .

Undo it . Undo it . Undo it .

Come in . I &apos;ve been waiting for you .
Hi ! I just <unk> ! ! ! Oh my God ! Oh my God !
Okay , I &apos;m sorry ! I &apos;m sorry ! I-I-I was um , I was taking a nap .
Since when do take <unk> in that position . Oh God Monica , tell me you were waiting for a guy ! Please tell me you were waiting for a guy !
Yes . Yes , I was . A guy . From work . I &apos;m seeing a guy from work ! Ha !
That cute waiter guy from your restaurant , the one that looks like a <unk> Ray <unk> ?
Uh-huh , that one !
Y &apos;know what , just give me a second and I &apos;ll be out of your hair . I &apos;m just gonna grab a jacket . When I get back , I want every little detail . Maybe that &apos;s him .
Okay , umm , okay , umm ... It &apos;s just Joey and Ross .
Why aren &apos;t you guys at the movie ?
Well , we were ! But Ross was talking so loud on his phone they threw us out !
I had to talk loud because the movie was loud !
He &apos;s talking to London !
But why ? ! Did he get in touch with Emily ?
Well no , not yet . He &apos;s calling everyone on her side of the family hoping that someone will help him get in touch with her .
I-I-I don &apos;t care if I said some other girl &apos;s name you <unk> , old <unk> !
Ross ! Way to suck up to the family .
<unk> . I &apos;m so glad you guys are all here ! My office finally got <unk> free <unk> paper !
Hey !
Oh no-no-no-no-no-no , vomit tux ! No-no , vomit tux !
Don &apos;t worry , I had it <unk> .
<unk> tux ? Who <unk> <unk> &apos;know what , what you up to Joe ?
Well , I &apos;m doing this telethon thing on TV and my agent got me a job as co-host !
Oh that &apos;s great !
A little uh , good deed for PBS and a little TV exposure , now that &apos;s the kind of math Joey likes to do !
Ugh , PBS !
What &apos;s wrong with PBS ?
Ugh , what &apos;s right with them ?
Why don &apos;t you like PBS , Pheebs ?
Okay , &apos; cause right after my mom killed herself , I was just in this really bad place , y &apos;know personally . So , I just thought that it &apos;d make me feel better if I wrote to Sesame Street , &apos; cause they were so nice when I was a little kid ! No one ever wrote back .
Well y &apos;know a lot of those <unk> don &apos;t have thumbs .
All I got was a lousy key chain ! And by that time I was living in a box . I didn &apos;t have keys !
I &apos;m sorry Pheebs , I just , y &apos;know , I just wanted to do a good deed . Like-like you did with the babies .
This isn &apos;t a good deed , you just wanted to get on TV ! This is totally selfish .
Whoa ! Whoa ! Whoa ! What about you , having those babies for your brother ? Talk about selfish !
What-what are you talking about ? !
Well , yeah , it was a really nice thing and all , but it made you feel really good right ?
Yeah . So ?
It made you feel good , so that makes it selfish . Look , there &apos;s no <unk> good deeds , sorry .
Yes there are ! There are totally good deeds that are selfless .
Well , may I ask for one example ?
Yeah , it &apos;s ... Y &apos;know there <unk> you may not !
That &apos;s because all people are selfish .
Are you calling me selfish ? !
Are you calling you people ? Yeah , well sorry to burst that bubble , Pheebs , but selfless good deeds don &apos;t exist . Okay ? And you the deal on Santa Clause right ?
I &apos;m gonna find a selfless good dead . I &apos;m gonna beat you , you evil genius .
Hello .
Hello , Ross ?
Emily ? Emily ! Oh my God ! Oh my God , it &apos;s Emily ! It &apos;s Emily everyone ! <unk> ! Hi !
Ross , I &apos;m only ringing to say stop <unk> my <unk> . Good-bye !
No wait ! Look , wait ! Okay , you can hang up , but I &apos;m gonna keep calling ! I &apos;m gonna , I &apos;m gonna call everyone in England if that &apos;s what it takes to get you to talk to me !
Really ? About what ?
Look you &apos;re my wife . We &apos;re-we &apos;re married . Y &apos;know ? I-I love you . I-I really miss you .
I miss you to . Well , at least I think I do .
She &apos;s talking .
Yay !
Hey , Joey , when you said the deal with Santa Clause , you meant ?
That he doesn &apos;t exist .
Right .
So Chandler , have you heard about Monica &apos;s secret boyfriend ?
Uhh , yeah . She uh , she uh , she uh might &apos;ve mentioned him .
So Mon , when are we gonna meet this new secret waiter man ?
Ohh , he &apos;s really shy . I-I don &apos;t think he &apos;s up to meeting everyone yet .
Yeah , I don &apos;t think he &apos;s up to meeting everyone yet .
I don &apos;t care ! I wanna meet this guy who &apos;s the best sex she ever had !
Really ? ! That &apos;s what you heard ? You said that ?
I might &apos;ve said that . Why is that funny ?
Because I &apos;m very happy for him ! And you , you lucky dog !
Hi !
Hey !
Well , Emily &apos;s willing to work on the relationship .
Yes !
That &apos;s great !
In London !
What ? !
She wants me to move to London .
But you live here ! You know that .
What-what-what are you gonna do ?
I bet if I talk to Carol and Susan I can convince them to move to London with Ben .
Yeah , I &apos;m sure your ex-wife will be more than happy to move to another country so you can patch things up with your new wife .
It could happen .
How ya doin &apos; ? Welcome . Good to see ya !
This will be your phone .
That &apos;s great . But uh , I &apos;m not really expecting a lot of calls .
No you answer it and take pledges .
But I &apos;m the host !
No , Gary <unk> is the host . You &apos;ll be answering the phones .
You don &apos;t seem to understand . See , I was Dr. Drake Remoray .
Well , here &apos;s your phone doctor .
I cannot believe I can &apos;t find a selfless good deed ! Y &apos;know that old guy that lives next to me ? Well , I <unk> over there and-and <unk> up all the leaves on his front <unk> . But he caught me and <unk> me cider and cookies . Then I felt wonderful . That old jackass !
Maybe Joey &apos;s right . Maybe all good deeds are selfish .
I will find a selfless good deed ! &apos; Cause I just gave birth to three children and I will not let them be raised in a world where Joey is right !
Hey , Monica ? Can I ask you a cooking question ?
Sure !
If you &apos;re cooking on the <unk> , does that mean that your new secret boyfriend is better in bed than Richard ?
Chandler ! Is he ?
Well , y &apos;know I-I-I think I &apos;m gonna respect the privacy of my new secret boyfriend .
Why ? ! I mean if this guy was me and it was me who had learned that it was me who was the best you &apos;d ever had , I &apos;d be going like this .
All right Emily , as much as I love you , I &apos;m sorry , I can &apos;t move to London without Ben .
I understand that would be difficult .
Yeah , would you please consider moving here ? I mean you were gonna move here anyway , why can &apos;t you just do that ?
I don &apos;t know , it &apos;s just ...
Oh-oh-okay , but-but I know , that even though I &apos;ve been a-a complete idiot up &apos; til now , I mean , I mean you-you-you have to come here . You have to come here so we can work this out .
All right .
All right , did you just say all right ?
I did . Now I &apos;m the idiot .
Oh , Emily that is , that is so great . It &apos;s gonna be so great ! We &apos;re gonna be <unk> two idiots in love !
Ross , there &apos;s one thing that really scares me still .
Yes , tell me .
Well , you have to understand how humiliating it was for me up on that altar in front of my entire family , all my friends .
I know . I am , I am so sorry .
And then after decided to forgive you , seeing you at the airport catching our plane with her .
Again , very sorry .
I mean , I can &apos;t-I can &apos;t be in the same room as her ! It drives me mad just thinking of you being in the same room as her !
Emily , there is nothing between Rachel and me . Okay ? I love you .
All right . I &apos;ll come to New York and we &apos;ll try and make this work .
Oh that is so great ! That &apos;s ...
As long as you don &apos;t see Rachel anymore .
So I asked Emily if she would come to New York , and she said yes .
Yes !
<unk> !
Great !
No-no-no ! Only if I promise never to see Rachel again .
Why ?
What ? ! You can <unk> did you tell her ?
I told her I &apos;d have to think about it . I mean , how the hell am I supposed to make this kind of a decision ? I &apos;m actually asking you !
Well , you can &apos;t just not see Rachel anymore , she &apos;s one of your best friends .
Yeah ! But , he can &apos;t not exactly see Emily , I mean that &apos;s his wife .
Yeah .
That &apos;s true !
Yeah , but you &apos;ve known Rachel since High School and you cannot just cut her out of your life .
That &apos;s true !
No , you cannot .
Thanks for the help , problem solved .

Welcome back to our fall telethon . Now if you &apos;ve been enjoying the performance of <unk> <unk> <unk> , and you &apos;d like to see more of the same kind of programming , it &apos;s very simple . All you have to do is call in your pledge and at that time tell the <unk> , one of our volunteers , what kind of programming you &apos;d like to ...
Okay , that &apos;s it . I cannot make this decision ! It is too difficult , so I &apos;m just gonna leave it entirely to the gods of fate .
A Magic Eight ball ? ! You can &apos;t be serious , you can &apos;t make this decision with a toy !
Ooh , it &apos;s not a toy .
Well , I don &apos;t know what else to do . I mean , I either keep my wife and lose one of <unk> best friends or I keep my friend and get divorced the second time before I &apos;m 30 ! So-so if anyone <unk> a better suggestion , let &apos;s hear it ! &apos; Cause I-I got nothing ! All right , don &apos;t be shy , any suggestion will do . Okay then . Here we go . Magic 8 Ball , should I never see Rachel again ? Ask again later . Later is not good enough . Ask again later . What the hell ! This is broken ! It-it is broken !
All right , let me see . Will Chandler have sex tonight ? Don &apos;t count on it . <unk> like it works to me .
PBS <unk> .
Hi Joey .
Hey Pheebs !
I would like to make a pledge . I would like to donate $ 200 .
$ 200 ? Are you sure Pheebs ? I mean , after what Sesame Street did to ya ?
Oh , I &apos;m still mad at them but I also now that they bring <unk> to lots of kids who &apos;s moms didn &apos;t kill themselves , so by supporting them , I &apos;m doing a good thing , but I &apos;m not happy about it . So there , a selfless good deed .
And you don &apos;t a little good about <unk> the money ?
No , it sucks . I was saving up to buy a hamster .
A hamster ? What , those things are like 10 bucks .
Yeah , not the one I had my eye on .
It looks like we have <unk> last year &apos;s pledge total ! Thank you <unk> ! The pledge that did it was taken by one of our volunteers ... Oh boy ! And may I say one of our <unk> dressed volunteers , Mr. Joseph Tribbiani !
Oh , look-look , Joey &apos;s on TV ! Isn &apos;t that great ? My pledge got Joey on TV ! Oh that makes me <unk> no !
Look , maybe I got carried away before . But there &apos;s something you gotta know . If I &apos;m the best , it &apos;s only because you &apos;ve made me the best .
Keep talking .
I mean I was nothing before you . Call the other girls and ask . Which wouldn &apos;t take long . But when I &apos;m with you , and we &apos;re together , OH ... MY ... GOD .
Really ?
<unk> my God ! Now , I understand if you never want to sleep with me again , but that would be wrong . We &apos;re too good ! We owe it , to sex !
Well , if we owe it ? Oh my ... When is Joey gonna be home ?
Well , I was kinda hoping we could do this without him . Oh no-no-no , leave the gloves on .
But , I just cleaned the bathroom .
Yeah , why don &apos;t we lose the gloves .
Yeah .
All right , let &apos;s show them how it &apos;s done .
Okay .
Ow !
Y &apos;know that wasn &apos;t part of it ?
I know !
Hi ! Are you ready ? We &apos;re gonna be late !
For what ?
For <unk> ! Remember ? She &apos;s gettin &apos; her <unk> back in like 20 minutes .
Yeah , I uh , totally forgot about that . You mind if I take a rain check ? I &apos;m waiting for a call from Emily .
Sure . I guess . Hey , I hear you don &apos;t have to go to London . Yay !
It &apos;s not that easy , there &apos;s still a lot of relationship stuff .
Like what ?
Just stuff . Y &apos;know kinda what Emily wants .
Well , why don &apos;t you talk to me about it , maybe I can help .
No . No . You-you can &apos;t help . I mean , I kinda have to do this without your help .
Well , I-I know you can do that too . I &apos;m just , I &apos;m just saying if you need somebody to talk to ... Hi !
Thanks .
Ross ? Look , whatever this relationship stuff that Emily wants , just give it to her . Come on , the bottom line here is that you love her . So just fix whatever she wants fixed . Just do it . I mean , you &apos;re gonna have to try . You &apos;ll just gonna hate yourself if you don &apos;t . Oh come on answer it ! It &apos;s driving me crazy !
Hello . Hi sweetie . Good . Look umm , yes I &apos;ve been thinking about that thing that you wanted me to do and , I can do it . So will you come to New York ?
Never done that before .
Nope .
Hi !
Hi !
Monica ? What time is it ?
Uhh , 9 .
But it &apos;s dark out .
Well that &apos;s because you always sleep to noon , silly ! This is what 9 looks like .
I guess I &apos;ll get washed up then . Watch that <unk> .
I &apos;m really getting tired of <unk> around .
I know , me too . Hey ! Y &apos;know what if we went away for a whole weekend ? Y &apos;know we &apos;d have no <unk> and we could be naked the entire time .
All weekend ? That &apos;s a whole lotta naked .
Yeah , I can say that I have a conference and you can say you have a chef thing .
Ohh , I &apos;ve always wanted to go to this culinary fair that they have in Jersey !
Okay , y &apos;know your not though . Let &apos;s go .
Wait ! What about Joey ?
Hey , guess what I &apos;m doing this weekend ! I &apos;m going to this culinary fair in New Jersey .
Oh weird , Chandler just told us he &apos;s got a conference there !
Oh now that-that-that &apos;s funny , it seems like Chandler &apos;s conference could &apos;ve been in <unk> or Vermont .
I &apos;m not in charge of where the conference is held . Do you want people to think it &apos;s a fake conference ? It &apos;s a real conference .
Hey .
Hey !
Hey .
Is Rachel here ? I gotta talk to her .
No , she &apos;s out shopping .
Damn !
What &apos;s going on ?
I told Emily to come . And I just need to y &apos;know , talk to Rachel about it .
Wait a minute ! So when Emily comes you &apos;re just , you &apos;re not gonna see Rachel anymore ?
Well look , I &apos;m just trying to focus on the &quot; I get to see my wife , &quot; part , all right ? And not the part that makes me do this .
Wow , so you guys are , you &apos;re never gonna be in the same room together ? How is that even gonna work ?
I have no idea . I mean ... But-but I assure you I will figure it out .
Doesn &apos;t seem like it &apos;s going to work , I mean ...
Hi , guys !
Hi !
Uh , hey !
What &apos;s going on ?
We &apos;re <unk> Monica &apos;s mattress .
So I &apos;m thinking , basically we pick it up and then we flip it .
Yeah that &apos;s better than my way .
Oh okay , hey guys , would you flip mine too ?
Aww , man !
Oh look ! A letter from my mom .
So , Rach , y &apos;know-y &apos;know how Emily &apos;s coming right ?
Oh yeah ! I know .
Can you hear anything ?
Oh yes , somebody just said , &quot; Can you hear anything ? &quot;
Hey , Joey &apos;s ass ! What are you doing ?
Well , remember when they got in that big fight and broke up and we were all stuck in her with no food or anything ? Well , when Ross said Rachel at the wedding , I figured it was gonna happen again , so I hid this in here .
Ooh , candy bars , crossword puzzles ...
Ooh , Madlibs , mine !
<unk> ?
You don &apos;t know how long we &apos;re gonna be in here ! We may have to <unk> the <unk> .
And condoms are the way to do that ?
Anyway it-it <unk> all <unk> down to this , the last time I talked to Emily ...
Oh my God ! My dog died !
What ? !
Oh my God , Le Poo , our dog !
Le Poo &apos;s still alive ? !
Oh God , it says he was hit by an ice cream truck and dragged for <unk> blocks . Oh . Oh my God .
Sweetie , we heard you crying . Please don &apos;t cry .
It &apos;s Le Poo .
I know it &apos;s <unk> <unk> right now , but it &apos;ll get better .
I can &apos;t believe it ! We &apos;re here !
Ooh , <unk> on the pillows ! I love that !
Oh , you should live with Joey , <unk> everywhere .
Come here . Okay , be right back .
Oh yes ! Monica , get in here ! There &apos;s a high-speed car chase on !
We &apos;re switching rooms .
Oh dear God , they gave us glasses !
No , they gave us glasses with lipstick on them ! I mean , if they didn &apos;t change the glasses , who knows what else they didn &apos;t change . Come on sweetie , I just want this weekend to be perfect , I mean we can change rooms , can &apos;t we ?
Okay , but let &apos;s do it now though , because <unk> 5 just lost it &apos;s feed !
Hey , so uh , y &apos;know how there &apos;s something I wanted to talk to you about ?
Oh yeah !
Well , y &apos;know how I &apos;m trying to work things out with Emily . Well , there &apos;s this one thing ... Okay , here goes . I made a promise <unk> hey !

Umm ...
Sorry . Sorry .
Okay , I uh , I can &apos;t see you anymore .
Yeah , I know . It &apos;s ridiculous ! I can &apos;t see you either .
I think you &apos;ll find this room more to your liking .
Okay , great .
They say he &apos;s only got half a tank left .
Half a tank ? We still got a lot of high-speed chasing to do !
We &apos;re switching rooms again .
What ? Why ?
This is a <unk> view room , and we paid for an ocean view room .
Our last ocean view room was unacceptable to you .
Excuse me , umm , can I talk to you over here for just a second ?
Uh-huh .
Chandler !
Yeah .
Look , these <unk> are trying to take us for a ride and I &apos;m not gonna let &apos; em ! And we &apos;re not a couple of <unk> !
I hear ya , <unk> ! But look , all these rooms are fine okay ? Can you just pick one so I can <unk> a perfect , magical weekend together with you .
Okay , this one I like !
Nothing ! It &apos;s over ! <unk> ! This is regularly scheduled programming !
Can we turn the TV off ? Okay ? Do we really want to spend the entire weekend like this ?
Oh , I &apos;m sorry , am I getting in the way of all the room switching fun ?
Hey , don &apos;t blame me for <unk> tonight !
Oh , who should I blame ? The nice bell man who had to drag out luggage to 10 different rooms ?
I don &apos;t know , how about the idiot who thought he could drive from <unk> to <unk> on a half a tank of gas !
Do not speak <unk> of the dead .
We &apos;re supposed to uh , be spending a romantic weekend together , it-it , what is the matter with you ?
I just want to watch a little television . What is the big deal ? Geez , relax mom .
What did you say ?
I said , &quot; Geez , relax <unk> . &quot;
Hi !
Hey . Rachel , I-I-I &apos;ve been wanting to tell you something for a while now and I really , I just have to get it out .
Okay , what &apos;s up ?
Okay , y &apos;know how you told me I should do whatever it takes to fix my marriage ?
Yeah , I told you to give Emily whatever she wants .
And while that was good advice , you should know that what-what she wants ...
Yeah ?
... is for me not to see you anymore .
That &apos;s crazy ! You can &apos;t do that ! What are you going to tell her ? Oh God . Ohh , you already agreed to this , haven &apos;t you ?
It &apos;s awful I know , I mean , I feel terrible but I have to do this if I want my marriage to work . And I do , I have to make this marriage work . I have too . But the good thing is we can still see each other until she gets here .
Ohh ! <unk> me ! Oh my God ! That is good news , Ross ! I think that &apos;s the best news I &apos;ve heard since Le Poo died !
You have no idea what a nightmare this has been . This is so hard .
Oh yeah , really ? Is it Ross ? Yeah ? Okay , well let me make this a just a little bit easier for you .
What are you doing ?

Rachel , this is your apartment .
Yeah , well that &apos;s how mad I am ! !
Damn <unk> !
Hey , you &apos;re back !
Hey .
How was your conference ?
It was terrible . I <unk> with my <unk> y &apos;know , the entire time . Are you kidding with this ?
Oh , so your weekend was a total bust ?
Uh , no , I got to see Donald Trump waiting for an elevator .
Hi !
Hey , you &apos;re back too !
Yeah . Umm , Chandler can I talk to you outside for a second ?
Hey , how was your chef thing ?
Oh , it was awful . I guess some people just don &apos;t appreciate really good food .
Well , maybe it was the kind of food that tasted good at first but then made everybody vomit and have <unk> .
Chandler !
Monica .
Okay , I &apos;d like to know how much the room was because I &apos;d like to pay my half .
Okay , fine , $ 300 .
300 dollars ? !
Yeah , just think of it as $ 25 <unk> room !
<unk> ! !
What are you guys <unk> about ?
Chandler stole a twenty from my purse !
Nooooo ! ! ! Y &apos;know what ? Now that I think about it , I constantly find myself without <unk> and you always have lots !
You should &apos;ve seen the look on her face . I don &apos;t want Rachel to hate me ! I don &apos;t know what to do .
You want my advice ?
Yes ! Please !
You &apos;re not gonna like it .
That &apos;s okay .
You got married to fast .
That &apos;s not advice !
I told ya .
I &apos;m going to the bathroom .
Man , if anyone asked me to give up any of you , I couldn &apos;t do it .
Yeah , me either .
Maybe I could do it .
Hi !
Hi , Rach .
Hi !
Hey .
Hey .
Look , I know you guys heard about the whole thing with me and Ross but y &apos;know , I &apos;ve been <unk> about it all day and I &apos;d just love not to talk about it . All right ?
I-I-I don &apos;t know if this falls under this category , but uh , Ross is right back there .
That &apos;s not Ross !
Oh no ! Not that guy ! He does look like him though .
Okay , Ross is in the bathroom .
Oh my God , its happening . It &apos;s already started . I &apos;m Kip .
Hey , you &apos;re not Kip !
Do you even know who Kip is ?
Who cares ? You &apos;re Rachel ! Who &apos;s Kip ?
Kip , my old roommate , y &apos;know we all used to hang out together .
Oh , that poor bastard .
See ? Yeah , you told me the story . He and Monica dated when they broke up they couldn &apos;t even be in the same room together and you all promised that you would stay his friend and what happened ? He got phased out !
You &apos;re not gonna be phased out !
Well , of course I am ! It &apos;s not gonna happen to Ross ! He &apos;s your brother . He &apos;s your old college roommate . Ugh , it was just a matter of time before someone had to leave the group . I just always <unk> Phoebe would be the one to go .
Ehh ! !
Honey , come on ! You live far away ! You &apos;re not related . You lift right out .
Hey !
Hey , Mr. Bing . That uh , hotel you stayed at called . <unk> someone left an eyelash curler in your room .
Yes that was mine .
&apos;Cause I figured you &apos;d hooked up with some girl and she &apos;d left it there .
Yes that would have made more sense .
Y &apos;know , I-I don &apos;t even feel like I know you anymore man ! All right , look , I &apos;m just gonna ask you this one time . And whatever you say , I &apos;ll believe ya . Were you , or were you not on a gay <unk> ? !
Phoebe ? I &apos;m sorry about the whole lifting out thing . You gotta come with me !
Come where ?
<unk> I go . Come on you and me , we &apos;ll-we &apos;ll start a new group , we &apos;re the best ones .
Okay , but try and get Joey too .
Pheebs , you mind if I speak to Rachel alone for a sec ?
Oh , sure ! Bye Ross ! Forever .
Hi .
Hi . What are you doing here ? Isn &apos;t this against the rules ?
I talked to Monica , look , I &apos;m the one who made the choice . I &apos;m the one who &apos;s making things change , so I should be the one to y &apos;know , step back .
Oh , Ross ...
No , no , it &apos;s okay . Really . They &apos;re plenty of people who just see their sisters at Thanksgiving and just see their college roommates at <unk> and just see Joey at <unk> King . So is , is that better ?
No , it &apos;s not better . I still don &apos;t get to see you .
Well , what-what would you do ? Rach , if you were me , what-what would you do ?
Well , for <unk> I would &apos;ve said the right name at my wedding !
I can &apos;t believe this is happening .
I know .
I am so sorry .
I know that too .
Hey , Rach ? Sorry to interrupt but umm , Phoebe wanted me to talk to you about a trip or something .
Hey !
Hi .
I just came over to drop off ... nothing . So that weekend kinda sucked , huh ?
Yeah , it did .
So , I guess this is over .
What ?
Well , y &apos;know , you and me , it had to end sometime .
Why , exactly ?
Because of the weekend , we had a fight .
Chandler that &apos;s crazy ! If you give up every time you &apos;d have a fight with someone you &apos;d never be with anyone longer <unk> !
So , this isn &apos;t over ?
You are so cute ! No . No , it was a fight . You deal with it and move on ! It &apos;s nothing to freak out about .
Really ? Okay . Great !
Ohh , welcome to an adult relationship !
We &apos;re in a relationship ?
I &apos;m afraid so .
Okay .
Hey !
Hey !
Oh hey , Monica , I heard you saw Donald Trump at your <unk> .
Yeah , I saw him waiting for an elevator .
Hey , Rach , can I borrow your eyelash curler , I think I lost mine .
Yeah , it &apos;s in there .

Joey , can I talk to you for a second ?
Oohh ! ! Ohh ! Oh-oh-oh ! Oh-oh ! !

Yes . Yes .
You ? ! And-and you ? !
Yes , but you cannot tell anyone ! No one knows !
How ? ! When ? !
It happened in London .
IN <unk> ! ! !
The reason we didn &apos;t tell anyone was because we didn &apos;t want to make a big deal out of it .
But it is a big deal ! ! I have to tell someone !
No-no-no-no-no ! You can &apos;t !
Please ? Please ? ! We just don &apos;t want to deal with telling everyone , okay ? Just promise you won &apos;t tell .
All right ! Man , this is unbelievable ! I mean , it &apos;s great , but ...
I know , it &apos;s great !
Aww , I don &apos;t want to see that !
We &apos;re so stupid ! Do you know what &apos;s going on in there ? They &apos;re trying to take Joey !
The most popular Phoebe in tennis is called the <unk> Phoebe . And if you win , you must slap your opponent on the Phoebe and say , &quot; Hi , Phoebe ! &quot;
Oh that &apos;s cute ! We really all enjoyed it . But y &apos;know , it doesn &apos;t count .
Count for what ?
Count in our heads as-as good Madlibs .
I guess I &apos;m done .
Fun &apos;s over !
Wait-wait , guys ! If-if we follow the rules , it &apos;s still fun and it means something !
Uh-huh !
I think I &apos;m gonna <unk> .
Guys , rules are good ! Rules help control the fun ! Ohhh !
Hey ! Hey ! Hey ! Hey ! ! None of that , not while you &apos;re living under my roof !
What ? !
Look , just because I know about you two , doesn &apos;t mean I like looking at it .
Aren &apos;t you supposed to be at an audition for another hour ?
Well , I &apos;m sorry if I &apos;m not a <unk> black woman ! And I &apos;m also sorry if sometimes I go to the wrong audition ! Okay , look , if I have to pretend I don &apos;t know about you two , then you two are gonna have to pretend there &apos;s nothing to know about .
Okay .
Sorry .
Sorry .
I can hear that !
Rachel &apos;s at work .
I can still hear you !
Hey !
Hey !
Hello !
Hey , what &apos;s that ?
Yeah , my mom sent me a family <unk> that once <unk> to my grandmother . Can you believe it ? ! A year ago I didn &apos;t even have a family , and now I have <unk> for crying out loud .
<unk> ! ! God !
<unk> ! ! Ooh , soft . Is this <unk> ?
Yeah ! Why would my mother send me a fur ? Doesn &apos;t she know me but at all ! Plus , I have a perfectly fine coat that no innocent animal <unk> to make !
Yeah , just some <unk> <unk> kids who worked their fingers bloody for 12 cents an hour . That didn &apos;t happen , I made that up !
Hey !
Oh , Ross ? Ross ! You can &apos;t put up flyers in here .
How come ? Everybody else does .
You can &apos;t .
What is that ?
Oh , umm , I &apos;m just getting rid of a couple of things .
This is all of your things .
Yes , yes it is ! No , but it &apos;s good it <unk> thinks we should get all new stuff . Stuff that &apos;s just ours , together . Y &apos;know brand new .
So basically , this is a <unk> sale .
<unk> . <unk> . <unk> on . <unk> on .
I &apos;ll take it all .
Hey , Ross , you &apos;re okay with that ?
Look , if I can just do what Emily wants and get her to New York , I &apos;m sure everything will be fine .
Okay , but don &apos;t you think this is a little <unk> ?
After what I did ? Can you blame her ?
Oh my God ! You got off easy ! When my friend <unk> &apos;s husband said someone else &apos;s name in bed , she <unk> him and turned his thingy green .
What is he doing ? What , Emily , thinks Ross &apos;s furniture has got Rachel <unk> ?
Now calm down Joey .
No ! Everything &apos;s gettin &apos; all messed up , y &apos;know ? Emily won &apos;t let Ross see Rachel , we &apos;re not gonna stop seeing Rachel , <unk> Ross stops seeing us !
Oh , I hate this . Everything &apos;s changing .
Yeah I know , we &apos;re losing Ross , Joey said <unk> ...
Look , I &apos;m not happy about this either , but y &apos;know if-if Ross says he &apos;s happy then we &apos;re just gonna have to keep our feelings about Emily to ourselves . Are you cool with that ?
No ! But y &apos;know , I &apos;m an actor , I &apos;ll act cool .
Ohh , whoa God ! <unk> rooms give me the creeps ! Monica , come on please hurry up honey ! Please ?
Rachel , if you want the little round <unk> , you gotta have to wait until I find the little <unk> iron .
I want the little round <unk> .
All right . Op , here it is ! Right underneath the can of-of bug <unk> . I wonder if the best place to put something that cooks food is underneath the can of <unk> ?
Okay , y &apos;know what ? I &apos;ll-I &apos;ll have toast !
Arghhhh ! ! ! ! ! !
Oh my God ! <unk> him ! <unk> him !
I don &apos;t know what I &apos;m gonna do about this coat .

You &apos;re on in 5 Ms. <unk> .
No-no-no , it &apos;s just a bit sudden . No , it &apos;s great . Okay ? I &apos;m totally on board . I love you too , all righty . Bye .
What &apos;s the matter Ross ?
Nothing . Oh , actually , great news ! I just got off the phone with Emily and it looks like I &apos;m moving to a new apartment . Woo-hoo !
Why ?
Well , her thought is , and I agree , fresh new furniture , why not a fresh new apartment ? Her cousin has this great place to <unk> , it &apos;s got a view of the river on one side and <unk> on the other .
That &apos;s way <unk> ! That &apos;s like three trains away ! Which is great ! I love to ride that <unk> !
So you &apos;re really okay with this ?
Yes ! Yes ! I mean it &apos;s-it &apos;s kinda far from work , but uh , y &apos;know , I &apos;ll get so much done on the <unk> . I-I &apos;ve been given the gift of time !
Now that &apos;s so funny , because last Christmas I got the gift of space . We should get them together and make a <unk> .
Now he &apos;s <unk> &apos; ? Man , what is Emily doing to him ? Ow ! ! He &apos;s not even here ! ! !
You guys ! You guys !
We were , we were just in the storage area and we saw this really creepy man !
It was like this <unk> , hairy <unk> man ! He was like a , like a <unk> or a yeti or something !
And he came at us with an <unk> , so Rachel had to use a bug <unk> on him !
Yeah , I-I-I just pulled the tab and I just fogged his yeti ass !
Uhh , like dark hair , <unk> beard ?
Yeah !
Yeah , you fogged Danny .
Please ! We did not fog Danny ! Who &apos;s Danny ?
Dan just moved in downstairs . Yeah , he just got back from like this <unk> <unk> in the <unk> . Nice fella .
Oh he &apos;s nice . He &apos;s nice ! Y &apos;know , you always stick up for the people we fog !
Yeah ?
Hi ! You might not remember us , but we are the girls that fogged you .
We &apos;re-we &apos;re really sorry we fogged you .
Okay .
Hi ! Just so you know , we-we didn &apos;t mean to fog you , we thought you were like a yeti or something .
Okay .
Yesss ?
Hi ! Sorry to bother you , but I don &apos;t think we can accept your <unk> of our apology , it just doesn &apos;t really seem like you mean it .
Yeah .
O-kay !
Wow ! That guy is so rude !
Really ! What is with that guy ? I mean you &apos;d forgive me if I fogged you .
Well you did a little bit .
Oh my God , honey , I &apos;m so sorry !

Oh my God ! Oh my God , look at these <unk> !
Don &apos;t get too attached , she &apos;s having it <unk> .
What ? Uhh , Phoebe , honey , honey , I know you &apos;re <unk> and I get a big kick out of it , we all do actually , but if you destroy a coat like this that is like a crime against nature ! Not nature , fashion !
This is fashion ? ! Okay , so to you , death is fashion ? ! That &apos;s really funny . Here &apos;s Phoebe umm , <unk> uh , y &apos;know , cutting edge hairy <unk> from y &apos;know , the steal <unk> of <unk> <unk> . I mean , you really thing this looks good ? &apos; Cause I do .
I know I miss you too . I can &apos;t wait to see you . I love you . Bye .
Okay , what is in here ? <unk> ?
No-no , this is my collection of <unk> <unk> .
So , rocks .
I &apos;m really gonna miss this apartment . Y &apos;know , <unk> took his first steps right over there .
Ohh . Hey , remember when I ran into this thing and it kinda knocked me out a little ?
I loved this place ! To tell you the truth , I wish I didn &apos;t have to move .
Uhh , are you saying that you &apos;re not entirely happy about this ?
Well , I mean if uh , if Emily gave me a choice ...
You do have a choice ! ! Ross , why are you listening to her ? ! Are you , are you crazy ? !
Why ?
It &apos;s not right what Emily wants you to do ! She is <unk> ! ! Stop <unk> me ! Look , now you guys said I only had to keep my mouth shut as long as Ross was happy , right ? Well he just told me that he &apos;s not entirely happy .
What &apos;s going on ?
We all hate Emily !
Nooo ! !
No , Ross , we do not hate Emily . We-we just , we just think that you &apos;re having to <unk> a whole lot to make her happy .
Yeah !

And where is your hat ?
It &apos;s in the kitchen , I &apos;ll go get it .
Ahh that &apos;s the 2 points .

Oh , I don &apos;t know about that .
Yeah , but then I can be you <unk> <unk> .

What one ? You wanted him to invite you to the party and he did it !
Yeah , but he <unk> until the last minute ! So if I said yes , he would know I had nothing better to do than wait around for an invitation to his stupid party . I said , &quot; No ! &quot; Which puts me right back in the driver seat .
Great . So the ball is in his court ?
Ball ? There is no ball .

Monica your <unk> doesn &apos;t work .
Phoebe , you have to lift it and point .
Oh . Aw , forget it .

Ooh-ooh , I ! I am thankful for this beautiful fall we &apos;ve been having .
That &apos;s very nice .
That &apos;s sweet , Joey .
Yeah , the other day I was at the <unk> and this lovely fall breeze came in out of nowhere and blew this chick &apos;s skirt right up . Oh ! Which reminds me , I &apos;m also thankful for <unk> .
I mean , it &apos;s not so much an <unk> as it is a <unk> of <unk> . I mean , it &apos;s amazing how much they can do with so little material ! And the way they play with your mind ! Is it there ? Is it not there ?
Are you aware that you &apos;re still talking ?
Is anyone thankful for anything else besides a <unk> ?
Huh , I don &apos;t know what to pick . Am I more thankful for my divorce or my <unk> ? Hmm .
Wow ! See , and I didn &apos;t think you &apos;d be able to come up with anything .
I &apos;m sorry . It &apos;s just that this is the worse Thanksgiving ever .
No-no-no ! I am the king of bad <unk> . You can &apos;t just swoop in here with your bad marriage and take that away from me .
Oh , you &apos;re not gonna tell the whole story about how your parents got divorced again are you ?
Oh God , no .
Oh , come on ! I wanna hear it ! It wouldn &apos;t be Thanksgiving without Chandler <unk> us out !
It &apos;s a tradition , like the <unk> . If the <unk> decided it was gay , moved out , and abandoned its entire family .
Now Chandler dear , just because your father and I are getting a divorce it doesn &apos;t mean we don &apos;t love you . It just means he would rather sleep with the <unk> than me .
More turkey Mr. Chandler ?
You &apos;re right . <unk> is worse . You are the king of bad <unk> .
I don &apos;t know about that . I &apos;ve got one that &apos;s worse .

Oh , did the little rich boy have a problem with the <unk> ? Yes , mine &apos;s worse !
More bandages ! More bandages ! Please , can I get some more bandages in here ! This man is <unk> Oh no .
In this life , Phoebe .
Oh , this life ! Oh okay no , Chandler &apos;s is worse .

Of course you don &apos;t sweetie . You &apos;re brand new .
I know Monica &apos;s worst Thanksgiving .
Oh , let &apos;s not tell this story .
Oh , come on !
Oh no , I know ! I know ! It &apos;s the one where Joey got Monica &apos;s turkey stuck on his head !
What ? ! Joey got a turkey stuck on his head ? !
Hey , it &apos;s not like it sounds .
It &apos;s exactly like it sounds .
Hello ?
Hello ?
Phoebe ?
Joey ? What &apos;s going on ?
Look .
Oh my God !

Easy . Step . How did it get on ?
I put it on to scare Chandler !

I can &apos;t ! It-it &apos;s stuck !
Well , I don &apos;t care ! That-that turkey has to feed 20 people at my parent &apos;s house and they &apos;re not gonna eat it off your head !

You did look like an idiot .
Hey , I wasn &apos;t the only one who looked like an idiot . All right ? Remember when Ross tried to say , &quot; <unk> <unk> ? &quot; And it came out , &quot; <unk> <unk> ? &quot;
Yeah that &apos;s the same .
That &apos;s it . That &apos;s my worse Thanksgiving .
Oh wait ! That can &apos;t be the one Rachel &apos;s talking about . She didn &apos;t even know that happened . So which one was it ?
Which one ?
Umm , I-I really don &apos;t want to tell this story .
Oh , come on Monica , <unk> past pain and getting depressed is what Thanksgiving is all about . Y &apos;know , for me anyway . And of course , the Indians .
Look umm , of all people , you do not want me to tell this story !
Monica ! I think Rachel &apos;s here !
I &apos;ll get it ! Happy Thanksgiving !
Not for me . Chip and I broke up !
Oh , why ? Why ? What happened ?

Well guys tend to get naked before they &apos;re gonna have sex .
What ? ! I mean , I didn &apos;t work this hard and-and-and lose all this weight so that I can give my flower to someone like him !
Okay , first of all , if you keep calling it that , no one &apos;s gonna ever take it . Then , second of all you &apos;re not actually gonna have sex with him ! You &apos;re just gonna make him think that you are .
Yeah .
Yeah .
And when he &apos;s naked I can throw him out in the front yard and lock the door and all the neighbors will just <unk> him !
Then , you will definitely get him back !
Okay , so how do I make him think I wanna have sex with him ?
Okay , oh , here &apos;s what you do . Just act like everything around you turns you on .
What do you mean ?
Well , like anything can be sexy . Like umm , <unk> , like this <unk> ! Ooh , ooh , this feels sooo good against my <unk> ! And-and if I feel a little hot , I can just <unk> myself with it . Or I can bring it down to my side and bring it through my fingers while I talk to him .
I can do that !
Yeah ? Okay ! Good , good , because he &apos;s coming . He &apos;s coming . Hey , what &apos;s up ?
Monica , I was wondering if you can make me some of that <unk> <unk> and cheese like last year .

Ross ?
Hey Chandler . Monica !
Ross , are you okay ?
I &apos;m fine ! I saw a psychiatrist at work today .
Why ? !
On <unk> of my rage .
Which I may say , right now , is out of control .
He gave me a pill for it .
A pill ?
Uh-huh . Well , when the psychiatrist told me I had to take a leave of <unk> because I yelled at my boss I started to get worked up again , so he offered me a <unk> . And I thought was a good idea so , I took it .
Wait a minute , they &apos;re making you take time off work ?
And you &apos;re okay with that ?
I don &apos;t know . It &apos;s going to be weird not having a job for a while , but I , I definitely don &apos;t care about my sandwich .
Ugh , that was so embarrassing ! I can &apos;t believe you let me go on and on like that !
I &apos;m sorry . It was just so funny when you started <unk> Jane Eyre to <unk> .
That was not funny !
Well , I <unk> ! Okay ? You weren &apos;t taking the class seriously .
Phoebe , come on ! What is the big deal ? I thought this was going to be something we could do together ! Y &apos;know , I thought it would be fun !

Monica , you asked the question .
Oh my God ! That &apos;s Monica ! !

What &apos;s going on ?
Joey has got a secret peephole !
Oh no ! No ! No ! No !

Look !
Dude ! That &apos;s my sister !
Give me that !
All right , wait ! Just wait . Everybody just calm down . Okay ? Let &apos;s give our friend Joey a chance to explain why he &apos;s such a big pervert !
No ! I am not a pervert ! Okay ? It &apos;s just ... I just ... Kinda ...
All right , look ! Look . I think I can explain this .
Thank you !
Joey &apos;s a sex addict .
What ? ! ! No I &apos;m not ! !
It &apos;s okay ! It &apos;s good ! It &apos;s good . It &apos;s a <unk> !
No ! No ! I am not a sex addict !
Yes you are ! That &apos;s the only way to explain all this stuff !
No it isn &apos;t ! No , it &apos;s not . Because you can also explain it with the truth !
Well , what is the truth ?
Yeah , what &apos;s going on ?
What &apos;s going on ?
I slept with Monica .
Well let &apos;s .... let &apos;s see what everybody thinks of that ?
Oh no !

This is not good for my rage .
Monica , is this true ?
Of course it &apos;s true ! How else would you explain all the weird stuff that &apos;s been going on ?
Yes it &apos;s true .
Okay , but if it only happened that one time , how come we found your underwear in our apartment the other day ?
<unk> ! That was the underwear I was wearing that night in London . Right Monica ?
I guess I wanted to keep it as a <unk> .
My God Monica ! !
Are you sure Joe ? Are you sure you &apos;re not just a sex addict ?
No ! If anyone &apos;s a sex addict here , it &apos;s Monica ! Yeah . Yeah . She has been trying to get me back in the <unk> ever since London !
So that &apos;s why she gave you a naked picture of herself .
That makes sense !
And the video camera ?
Uhh , Monica ?
I guess I set up the video camera to try and entice Joey .
But <unk> I could not be <unk> .
Unbelievable ! I mean you really kept Joey &apos;s underwear ? ! Why ? Why would you do that ? !
I &apos;m Monica . I &apos;m disgusting . I stalk guys and keep their underpants .
Well , I think we &apos;ve all learned something about who &apos;s disgusting and who &apos;s not . Eh ? All right , now , I &apos;m going to get back to my bucket . I &apos;m only eating the skin , so the chicken &apos;s up for grabs .
I really thought you making a good point . I mean y &apos;know , until you got cut off .
Yeah , what &apos;s up with that girl Monica ?

I didn &apos;t finish my five pages .
Well , why can &apos;t you do them tomorrow ?
Because tomorrow he &apos;s <unk> yesterday &apos;s pages .
Yesterday &apos;s pages did not <unk> my best work .
Why don &apos;t you cut him a little <unk> ? Okay ? Maybe if he <unk> a little bit , he &apos;ll get some work done .
I think he &apos;s been relaxing enough , thanks to you and Fireball .
Dude , if you think Fireball &apos;s relaxing , you &apos;ve obviously have never played .
The only reason you &apos;re doing this to Joey is because you &apos;re bored . Okay , it &apos;s not his fault that you &apos;re unemployed .
I am not unemployed . I &apos;m on sabbatical !
Come on look guys , don &apos;t fight .
And the reason I &apos;m doing this is because I am Joey &apos;s friend . And if you were a good friend , you &apos;d be doing the same thing .
Oh , so being a good friend means acting like a total jerk ?
If it does ? Then you &apos;re an amazing friend of mine .
Hey-hey guys , hey ! How about we settle this over a friendly game of Fireball ? Huh ? I &apos;ll go <unk> the smoke <unk> !
How about we settle this right now ! There ! Now , no one &apos;s going to the game . Ha-ha-ha !

Don &apos;t you remember when we were <unk> in the park and we saw that really pretty bird and wanted to take a <unk> didn &apos;t have my camera !
Oh yeah . First off all , chasing the <unk> guy isn &apos;t <unk> .
Oh , this is so good you have got to try it .

Are you close with them ?
No-no , they &apos;re not very nice people .
Okay , listen , I really like you . Okay ? I think this can go somewhere . So what if I &apos;m close to my family , are you gonna let that stand in the way of us ?
Well , uh , I-I don &apos;t know . See when-when you put it that way y &apos;know it does sort of ...

That &apos;s good one too , Pheebs . Now all you have to do is find a <unk> of people who &apos;s resolution is to <unk> to their <unk> .
Maybe your resolution is to not make fun of your friends , especially the ones who may soon be flying you to Europe for free on their own plane .
She has a better chance of <unk> wings and flying up your nose than you do of not making fun of us .
In fact , I &apos;ll bet you 50 bucks that you can &apos;t go the whole year without making fun of us . Eh , y &apos;know what , better yet ? A week .
I &apos;ll take that bet my friend . And you know what , paying me the 50 bucks could be the &quot; new thing you do that day ! &quot; And it starts right now !
All right , my New Year &apos;s resolution is to learn how to play the guitar .
Ohh .
Really ? ! How come ?
Well , y &apos;know those special skills I have <unk> on my resume ? I would love it would be great if one of those was true .
Do you want me to teach you ? I &apos;m a great teacher .

Op , look ! <unk> forgot her glasses ! And she &apos;s gonna be really needing these to keep an eye on that boyfriend , who , I hear , needs to keep his <unk> in his desk drawer , if you know what I &apos;m talking about .
Hey Rach , maybe your resolution should be to umm , gossip less .

Well , maybe sometimes I find out things or I hear something and I pass that information on y &apos;know kinda like a public service , it doesn &apos;t mean I &apos;m a gossip . I mean , would you call <unk> <unk> a gossip ?
Well if <unk> <unk> talked about his <unk> <unk> boob jobs , I would .

Okay , so now they know that you know and they don &apos;t know that Rachel knows ?
Yes , but y &apos;know what ? It doesn &apos;t matter who knows what . Now , enough of us know that we can just tell them that we know ! Then all the lying and the secrets would finally be over !
Or , we could not tell them we know and have a little fun of our own .
Wh-what do you mean ?
Well y &apos;know every time that they say that like they &apos;re doing laundry we &apos;ll just give them a bunch of laundry to do .
Ohhh , I-I would enjoy that !

Well actually you &apos;re the one person I can &apos;t tell this too . And the one person I want to the most .
What &apos;s going on ?

The <unk> thing happened at the coffee house , I think , I think Phoebe was hitting on me .
What are you talking about ?
I &apos;m telling you I think Phoebe thinks I &apos;m <unk> .
That &apos;s not possible !
Ow !
I &apos;m sorry it &apos;s just , Phoebe just always thought you were , you were charming in a , in a <unk> kind of way .
Oh , y &apos;know I-I can &apos;t hear that enough .
I &apos;m sorry , I think that you just misunderstood her .
No , I didn &apos;t <unk> , okay ? She was all over me ! She touched my bicep for crying out loud !

Well what did you send ?
A basket of <unk> .
But there &apos;s a whole table of <unk> baskets . Which one did you send ?

Okay , so now do you believe that she &apos;s attracted to me ?
Ohhh , oh my God ! Oh my God ! She knows about us !
Are you serious ?
Phoebe knows and she &apos;s just trying to freak us out ! That &apos;s the only explanation for it !
Okay but what about y &apos;know my <unk> butt and my <unk> <unk> knows !
Joey !

Phoebe knows about us !
Well I didn &apos;t tell them !

Uhhh , Phoebe and Joey .
Joey !
And Rachel . I would &apos;ve told you but they made me promise not to tell !
Oh man !
I &apos;m sorry ! But hey , it &apos;s over now , right ? Because you can tell them that you know they know and I can go back to knowing absolutely nothing !
Unless ...
No ! Not unless ! Look this must end now !
Oh man , they think they are so <unk> messing with us ! But see they don &apos;t know that we know that they know ! So ...
Ahh yes , the <unk> become the <unk> !
Noooo .
Oh Ross , honey you gotta stop torturing yourself !
Yeah , why don &apos;t you just find another apartment ?
Look I &apos;ve already looked at like a thousand apartments this month and none of them even <unk> to that one !
Y &apos;know what you should do ?
Huh ?
You should find out what his <unk> are and then use that to bond with him . Yeah ! Like if I would <unk> up a conversation about say umm , sandwiches . Or uh , or my underwear .
I &apos;m listening .
See ?
That is a great idea ! And ! I know Ugly Naked Guy because we &apos;ve been watching him for like five years so that gives me back my edge ! Oh , let &apos;s see now he had the <unk> .
He broke that .
Well , he had <unk> boots .
Yeah , he broke those too .
So he likes to break stuff .
Okay , I &apos;ve got to go pick up Ben but I-I will figure something out . Hey , didn &apos;t he used to have a cat ?

Hi !
Hi !
Welcome to the building . I &apos;m uh , Steve Sarah ; I &apos;m president of the <unk> <unk> .
Oh hi ! Ross Geller . And this is my friend Phoebe .
Oh hi Phoebe .
Mr. President .
I came to talk to you about Howard .
Howard ?
Yeah , he &apos;s the handy man . He &apos;s gonna be <unk> next week and everyone who lives here is kicking in a 100 bucks as a thank you for all the hard work type of thing .
Oh that &apos;s nice .
Yeah . So , do you want to give a check ? Or ...
Oh . Uhh ...
Oh look , you don &apos;t have to give it too me right now ! You can slip it under my door .
No-no , it &apos;s not that , it &apos;s just ... I-I just moved in .
Well , the guy &apos;s worked here for 25 years .
Yes , but I &apos;ve lived here for 25 minutes .
Oh , okay , I get it .
No wait , look . Look ! I &apos;m sorry , it &apos;s just I &apos;ve never even met Howard . I-I mean I don &apos;t know Howard .
Howard &apos;s the handy man !
Yes but too me he &apos;s just , man .
Okay , fine , whatever . Welcome to the building .
Ugh , can you believe that guy !
Yeah . I really like his glasses .
... so then President Steve told everyone that I was a <unk> , and now the whole building hates me ! A little kid spit on my knee ! Y &apos;know what I &apos;m gonna do ? I &apos;m gonna throw a party . That &apos;s right . For everyone in the building , and I &apos;m gonna sit them down and explain to them , I am not a bad guy . I am not a cheap guy ! I &apos;m just a guy who-who stands up for what he believes in . A man with principles .
Sounds like a fun party .
Hmm . Look , Ross , if you want your neighbors to like you , why don &apos;t you just pay the hundred bucks ? The party &apos;s gonna cost you way more than that .
It doesn &apos;t matter ! It &apos;s my principles ! We &apos;re talking about my principles !
Okay , I thought it was about your neighbors liking you .
Oh , they &apos;ll like me . Once they come to my awesome <unk> ! Okay , I gotta run . I gotta go get some <unk> .
And that crazy party animal will be your <unk> .
Very , very funny , but don &apos;t say things like that in front of Monica . I don &apos;t want you putting any ideas in her head .
Umm , Chandler , you do realize that those ideas are probably already in Monica &apos;s head .
Wh-wh-why ? !
Well , because she loves you and because you love her .
Yeah , so , what &apos;s that supposed to mean ? !
Hey , Chandler , don &apos;t freak out ! I &apos;m telling you something you already know ! Come on , she broke up with Richard because he didn &apos;t want to have babies . And she &apos;s a woman , and she &apos;s almost 30 , and y &apos;know it &apos;s Monica .
I don &apos;t see it that way . Okay ? Because , I see two <unk> , the one that was my friend , who lived across the hall , and wanted to have a lot of babies and then the new Monica , who I just started to date . Now , who &apos;s to say what she wants ? ! I &apos;m right . I &apos;m right . Am I right ?
No , you &apos;re right , you are absolutely right . I mean that makes , that makes everything different .
Okay . It &apos;s not different at all , is it ?
Not unless different means the same .
You were so funny with that waiter ! You &apos;re such a nut !
Y &apos;know , <unk> <unk> are always funny .
No , you make them funny . You &apos;re the funny one !
Uhh , look Katie , uh listen , we-we need to talk . Okay ? Umm , look I like you . I-I really do , I like you a lot . Okay ? But sometimes when you , when you <unk> punch me like that it-it feels like someone &apos;s hitting me with a very tiny but very real bat .
Aww , like I could hurt you . Are you making fun of my size ? Don &apos;t make fun of me because of my size !
Isn &apos;t this great ?
Hmm .
<unk> &apos;t you just stay like this forever ? Chandler ! <unk> &apos;t you just stay here forever ?

All right , everyone calm down ! Everyone calm down ! I have something that I would like to say ! Who here likes Ross ? Of course you don &apos;t like him ! He-he didn &apos;t give you any money , he raised his own hand when I asked , &quot; Who hear likes Ross , &quot; and he &apos;s wearing two <unk> ! I-I &apos;ll be honest with you guys , when I first met Ross I didn &apos;t like him at all ! But then once I got to know him I saw that he &apos;s really sweet and caring and very generous . I mean , all I &apos;m saying is don &apos;t judge Ross before you get to know him all right ? I mean , I like all you guys now , but when I first meet you y &apos;know <unk> , I thought , y &apos;know <unk> drunk , umm <unk> , mind <unk> stupid ! And okay , you guys <unk> , <unk> robbing <unk> ! So , I think you all know what I mean .
Obviously I didn &apos;t think they were gonna start throwing things . I just thought if I kept <unk> everyone , you would jump in and defend everyone and then you could look like the hero .
Oh wow , yeah ! See , I did not get that .
Where &apos;s Monica ? ! Where is she ? I need to talk to her ! It &apos;s <unk> ! Is she here ?
I &apos;m Monica .

Okay .
Okay , I &apos;ve been doing a lot of thinking about us , y &apos;know a lot of uhh , us thinking . And uh , well I guess there &apos;s only one-one way to do this .
Wait <unk> are you doing ? !
Monica ...
No-no , don &apos;t-don &apos;t-don &apos;t do it !
Will you marry me ?
Oh-no . No . No .
What a bad idea !
Ohhhh , I cannot look at it !
Chandler , why are you doing this ?
I don &apos;t know . But I know I &apos;m not afraid to do this .
Chandler .
I &apos;m doing this because I &apos;m sorry ?
Do you umm , you really think the best reason to get married is because you &apos;re sorry ?
No , the best reason to get married is pregnancy . Sorry is pretty much fourth y &apos;know , behind being ready and actually wanting to get married . Will you be my wife ?
Chandler , umm , I want you to take just a minute and I want you to think about how ridiculous this sounds .
Yeah , I &apos;m kinda <unk> everyone wasn &apos;t here right now .
Honey ! Do you know that none of that stuff came from me ? ! I mean I never said I wanted to have babies and get married right now !
Yeah I know , but I was really <unk> and then I talked to these guys .
Who ? Two divorces and Joey ? !
Hey !
She &apos;s right y &apos;know .
Yeah , but still , cheap shot !
Y &apos;know what ? Y &apos;know when I said that I want you to deal with this relationship stuff all on your own ? Well , you &apos;re not ready for that .
I didn &apos;t think I was !
Oh my God , what would have done if I said yes ?
Well I would &apos;ve been happy because I would &apos;ve be able to spend the rest of my life with the woman that I love . Or , you would &apos;ve seen a Chandler <unk> hole in that door .
Hey Ross , will you pass me that knife ?
No , I will not !
Oh , it &apos;s okay . You don &apos;t have to be so mean about it .
You &apos;re right , I &apos;m sorry . Will you marry me ?
Aw , and I was gonna ask you to marry me because I forgot to say hello to you last week .
Oh no wait Pheebs , I think for something like that you just ask them to move in with you . But I &apos;m not sure , Chandler ?
Okay , how long is this going to go on .
Well I think the length of <unk> is directly related to how insane you were so , a long time .
This is fun . Hey Rach , remember that whole &quot; We were on a break thing ? &quot; Well , I &apos;m sorry , will you marry me ?
That &apos;s not funny .
That &apos;s not funny at all !

It-it doesn &apos;t ?
No !
No , it can mean anything . Like uh , all of the sudden you &apos;re jealous because I &apos;ve become the apartment <unk> .
That kinda sounds like your dream dude .
Or , it could mean that-that you saw Chandler and me together and we y &apos;know were being close and stuff and then you just want to have that with someone too .
In the dream I did enjoy the closeness .
Um-hmm .
Joey , look , are you attracted to Monica ? Right here , right now , are you attracted to her ?
Not really .
Well there you have it !
Well sure ! I &apos;m just wearing sweats ! But that &apos;s good that you &apos;re not in love with me , because you just want a girlfriend !

Uh , hey , Rach let me ask you something . Uh , I was just over there talking to Monica and Chandler , boy they are really tight .
I know .
Yeah that &apos;s not such a bad situation they got going over there . I &apos;m thinking of getting me one of those .
What &apos;s up Joe ?
Well , the reason I think Monica and Chandler are so great ...
Yeah ?
... is because they were friends first . Y &apos;know ? So I asked myself , &quot; Who are my friends ? &quot; You and Phoebe , and I saw you first . So ...
What are you saying ?
I &apos;m saying maybe you and I <unk> it up a notch .
Y &apos;know honey , umm , as uh , as <unk> as I am that uh , you saw me first , uhh , I just , I-I don &apos;t think we should be <unk> anything up .
I &apos;ll treat you real nice .
Yeah , well , y &apos;know umm ... No honey , listen I think it &apos;s a great idea to become friends with someone before you date them , but I think the way you do it is y &apos;know you meet someone , become their friend , build a <unk> , then you ask them out on a date . Don &apos;t hit on your <unk> friends !
Won <unk> &apos;t that take longer ?
Yeah . Yeah . Oh , but once you find it , ohh it &apos;s so worth the wait .

Oh , we &apos;re not seeing a movie !
You &apos;re not ? Then why did you ask us if we wanted to go ?
Oh umm , that &apos;s because I just wanted to y &apos;know walk in on me and Chandler while we were , y &apos;know , doing it all night . Will you excuse me for just a second ?
Yeah !
Okay . Chandler ? Can I see you for a second ?
Uh , yeah .
Okay . We have got to beat them ! { Here we go yet again . }
Why ?
&apos;Cause , Gary and Phoebe think they &apos;re a hotter couple than we are !
Ohh , so ?
So ! So we &apos;ve got to go upstairs and have a lot of sex to prove them wrong !
Monica , you have got to stop this competitive thing ! Okay ? It &apos;s crazy . { Finally ! The voice of reason . } I mean , just <unk> Gary and Phoebe we have to go upstairs and have sex over and over and I &apos;m saying no to this , why ? Get your coat .
Hey !
Excuse me . You should check this out , tell the other <unk> . Apparently he &apos;s running around looking for some kind of a hot girl .
Who isn &apos;t ?
I don &apos;t , I don &apos;t think we &apos;ve meet . I-I &apos;m Ross .
I know . You &apos;re the guy who wouldn &apos;t <unk> in for the <unk> .
Nevermind !
No , I-I actually thought it was unfair the way everyone <unk> . I mean you had just moved in .
I had just moved in . Thank you ! Listen umm ...
Jen .
Jen , I know this may sound a little ... But uh , would you maybe wanna grab a cup of coffee sometime , or ...
Sure ! That would be nice .
Umm ?
Oh ! My number is on there . Give me a call .
I will give you a call .
I &apos;ll see you later .
Okay !
I forgot my paper .
That was amazing !
Phoebe and Gary are so gonna hear about this at dinner .
That was amazing .
We are the <unk> ! Huh ? No one is hotter than we are ! You &apos;re the best .
No , you &apos;re the best .
No , you &apos;re the best .
No , you &apos;re the best .
I am the best .
Hey guys ! What &apos; cha been doin &apos; ?
Hey Joey ! Isn &apos;t that the girl that <unk> at you the other day ?
I don &apos;t know . But I can see through your sheet . Yeah , yeah , that &apos;s her . But y &apos;know what ? Doesn &apos;t matter , I &apos;m never gonna get to meet her anyway .
Why ?
Because it &apos;s impossible to find her apartment ! She lives in some like of hot girl <unk> universe , or something .
What are you talking about ? She obviously lives on the second floor , seventh apartment from the left !
No . No . No . She lives on the third floor , <unk> apartment from the left .
No , those first two <unk> , that &apos;s the <unk> . And y &apos;know the other one over there , that &apos;s the <unk> . You &apos;ve been counting wrong .
I did not know that ! Thank you Monica . I can &apos;t believe I almost lost another girl because of counting .
So uhh , you ready ?
Sure , I &apos;ll just get my coat . Could you get that ?
Sure . Joey ...
<unk> ! ! No ! Noooo ! !
Ah , first , I-I would like to say thank you for agreeing to see me again .
That &apos;s quite all right , but I feel <unk> to tell you that this meeting is being <unk> .
Okay . Umm , well , first I would like to start by apologizing for kissing you and uh , for yelling at you .
Fair enough .
Now you &apos;re probably going to hire one of the people who did not ah , who did , who did not umm , yell at you and storm out , and I think that &apos;s a big mistake and here &apos;s why . I made a huge fool of myself and I came back , that shows courage . When I thought you wanted sex in exchange for this job , I said no . That shows integrity . And , I was not afraid to stand up for myself and that shows courage . Okay umm , now I know I already said courage , but y &apos;know you gotta have courage . And umm , and finally when I thought you were making sexual advances in the <unk> , I said no and I was not litigious . { By the way , litigious means to want to <unk> and <unk> is to make a <unk> against . So she didn &apos;t want to sue him . Don &apos;t worry , I had to look it up too . } So there you go , you got , you got courage , you got integrity , you got courage again , and not litigious . Look <unk> ...
Zelner .
Zelner ! Right ! I knew that ! I really , really want this job and I think , I think I would be really good at it .
Y &apos;know what ? I may <unk> this but uh , I &apos;m going to give you a shot .
Oh ! You are ?
Um-hmm .
Really ? Oh thank you ! Oh ... Oh , would it be completely inappropriate to give you a hug ?
Yes !
Okay , well then how about a handshake ? Oh God I &apos;m sorry ! Oh God , I &apos;m sorry ! I did not mean to touch <unk> mean you there . There . Uhh , okay , so <unk> you , I &apos;m going to leave now thank you very much uh-huh , thank you <unk> ! I &apos;ll see you Monday !
You tired Chandler ?
You better believe he &apos;s tired , after the day we had ! If you know what I mean . You know what I mean ?
Honey , the <unk> chips know what you mean .
So uh Chandler , you like that badge I got you ?
Oh yeah , it &apos;s so cool . Now I gotta go , <unk> Bing has gotta , <unk> . That &apos;s <unk> .

Yes it is . You see I &apos;ve always found the men &apos;s bathroom very sexual . Haven &apos;t you ?
No . And if I did , I don &apos;t think we &apos;d be going out . Monica , this is getting ridiculous !
Come on , we can &apos;t let them win !
Ugh , we have already proved that we are hot ! Okay ? So why-why are you getting so obsessed about this thing ? !
Because Phoebe and Gary are in <unk> <unk> phase !
So ?
I feel really sad that we &apos;re not ... really there anymore .
Oh wow ! Is that what this all have been about ?
Wasn &apos;t it a lot more exciting when we were y &apos;know all over each other all the time ?
Yeah that was great . That was really great ! But to tell you the truth , I &apos;m more excited about where we are right now .
Really ?
Yeah ! I &apos;ve never been in a relationship that &apos;s lasted this long before . Y &apos;know to get past the beginning and still be around each other all the time , I think that &apos;s pretty incredible . And the fact that this is happening all with you , yeah I think that &apos;s pretty exciting .
That is so sweet . I know that I was acting a little crazy but umm , I feel the same way .
Yeah ?
Yeah .
Y &apos;know what I just realized ? You just freaked out about our relationship .
Did not .
Yes you did ! <unk> it ! You freaked out !
Okay , I freaked out a little .
Little ? ! You freaked out big time ! Okay ? And I fixed it ! We have switched places ! I am the relationship and king and you are the crazy , <unk> screw up ! And now we &apos;re back .
I cannot believe Ross is buying this !

Whoa-whoa dad ? There &apos;s a dad in the commercial ?
Yeah the dad and Ben eat soup and pretend to enjoy it .
Whoa , hey , maybe I &apos;ll go down there with ya and see if I can get an audition to play the dad . I mean who better to play Ben &apos;s father than his godfather .
You &apos;re not his godfather .

Hey , that kid looks familiar .
Oh yeah , yeah ! He &apos;s done tons of commercials . I &apos;ve seen him in like <unk> <unk> , <unk> , and that one for the phone company . In fact he was so good in that one , he actually convinced me to switch phone companies . Chandler was mad ....
Yeah well , he &apos;s not gonna get this one . Ben is way <unk> than that kid . I mean look at him , look at you ,
That &apos;s great . Listen , wouldn &apos;t it be great though if I got to play Ben &apos;s dad ?
Joey , you look nothing like Ben .
I look more like him than you do !
Y &apos;know , I don &apos;t really know you well enough for you to do that .
So it &apos;s down to these two , Nancy I know you like this one and I think I agree . Rachel , what do you think ?

Rachel ? Do you smoke ?
Oh no , my dad &apos;s a doctor and he would always tell me just <unk> stories ...... about ghosts and <unk> who totally supported the princess &apos;s right to smoke .

That doesn &apos;t seem fair .
I know ! It &apos;s like I &apos;m being <unk> for not having this disgusting , poisoning <unk> !
Yeah , it is the best .
I mean what if this keeps happening ? Y &apos;know , they <unk> &apos;ll be outside smoking , making all the decisions and I &apos;ll just be up in my office breathing my stupid clean air , y &apos;know ? And then when the day comes when Kim wants to <unk> one of us , who do you think she &apos;s gonna pick ? Me or Smokey <unk> ?
Rachel , you can go down there , you don &apos;t have to smoke . Just say you wanna get some fresh air .
Yeah , I can do that .

Well , if you &apos;re gonna be totally <unk> about this , I can &apos;t argue with you ! All right ? Fine , if you wanna tell him , tell him . I just don &apos;t want to be a part of it .
Oh , maybe that &apos;s Emily calling back to leave the exact same message .
Hey Ross ! It &apos;s you ! I just want you to remember this feeling . You are lucky to be alive ! So live everyday to the <unk> . Love yourself , okay ? Okay . Oh , and also get stamps . Bye !
Wow ! <unk> that message for Emily and this whole problem goes away !
Right ?
Hey , anybody want to meet a hero ?
John <unk> is here ? !
No , Joey !
Pheebs , we had the most incredible night ! Okay , so , we &apos;re in the car ...
Wait ! Hold on ! Hi !
Hi !
Okay , go ahead .
Okay , okay , so we &apos;re in the car . Right ? And bang ! A shot was fired . And Joey with no <unk> for his own safety <unk> himself on me !
My God , Joey !
It was a car backfire !
Yeah , but-but he didn &apos;t know that !
Yeah , I didn &apos;t know that .
And it could &apos;ve just as easily have been a bullet .
Hey Joe , you ever think about <unk> the force ? We could use a guy like you .
Who <unk> at loud noises !
Wow ! I could &apos;ve died tonight .
Yeah ! If the car that backfired had run over you ! Y &apos;know what , I think I &apos;ll go home before Ross starts <unk> about his <unk> respect for life .
I do have a <unk> respect for life .
Oh my God !
So you wanna get some dinner ?
Yeah ! Sure ! Yep ! Oh , y &apos;know what ? If I heard a shot right now , I &apos;d throw my body on you .
Oh yeah ? Well maybe you and I should take a walk through a bad neighborhood .
Okay !
All right .
Bye !
Bye !
Cut it out Ross ! I hate to have to save your life and kick your ass in the same day !
Dude ! How come you took off ?
Oh , I just went for a walk , around the living room . Whatever ...
Is something wrong ?
No . No I &apos;m just tired . Y &apos;know , <unk> the walk .
Okay .
You <unk> in front of Ross ! Ross !
That &apos;s what this is about ! Oh my God , you hate Ross !
I do not hate Ross !
Of course you do ! I saved him ! You &apos;re mad at me ! It all <unk> up ! You want Ross out of the picture .
What picture ?
I don &apos;t know , but I don &apos;t like what I &apos;m hearing !
Look I &apos;m very glad that you saved Ross from the car backfire , but y &apos;know , it could &apos;ve been a bullet and you y &apos;know , you didn &apos;t try to save me !
Ohh , you &apos;re upset because you think I chose Ross over you ! No ! I ... knew ... you could take care of yourself . Y &apos;know , I mean Ross , he need help . He &apos;s not street like us !
When it comes down to it , you would <unk> your life for Ross before you would for me . That &apos;s the bottom line .
Well , no , not exactly ! All right , look , I , I wasn &apos;t trying to save Ross . Okay ? My sandwich was next to Ross . All right ? I was , I was trying to save my sandwich .
From a bullet !
I know it doesn &apos;t make much sense ...
<unk> sense ? !
Look Chandler , it was <unk> ! Okay ? I just went for it !
So you <unk> your life , for a sandwich !
I know it sounds crazy , but Chandler this is the greatest sandwich in the world !
So you didn &apos;t uh , choose Ross before me .
No ! I would never do that ! You-you &apos;re like my brother !
Really ? !
Yeah ! In fact , to prove how much you mean to me , here .
Thanks .
No , eh , <unk> , easy , it &apos;s not a hot dog !
How good is that ?
<unk> , yeah !
See ?
<unk> .
<unk> , dude , what are you doing ? !
I thought you were showing me how much you mean to me .
Yeah . With a bite ! <unk> !
Hey ! Hi !
Rach , what uh , what are you doing here ?
Hey ! Y &apos;know what ? You are in our apartment all the time ! Okay ? This is , this is just a drop in the bucket mister !
Y &apos;know , it-it doesn &apos;t matter . The important thing is that you &apos;re here . You &apos;re my friend , and you &apos;re here . Oh !
Okay , just a little scared . What &apos;s going on Ross ?
The most amazing thing happened tonight . I thought my number was up . I had an actual near death experience !
What ? ! What ? What happened ? !
Okay , okay , we were on the ride along with Gary , right ?
Yeah !
And somebody took a shot at me !
Really ? !
No , a car backfired , but I thought somebody was taking a shot at me . And Rach , I ... I survived ! And I was filled with this-this great respect for life . Y &apos;know ? I-I want to experience every moment . I want to seize every opportunity . I-I am seeing everything so-so clearly now .
Because a car backfired ?
Okay , why are you here ?
Well , I-I-I don &apos;t know how this <unk> into your whole &quot; <unk> &quot; thing but um , Emily called you today .
You talked to her ?
No , she left a message . But it-it kinda got erased . There &apos;s just something wrong with your machine .
Well , okay , what-what did she say ?
Well , uh something about having second thoughts about the wedding and did you guys make a mistake breaking up and uh , she wants you to call her .
Wow !
Now , that-that was a good thing that I told you , right ?
Huh ? Yeah ! Yes , of course !
Okay . Thank you ! Thank you ! <unk> &apos;m sorry , all right . Because y &apos;know what ? She didn &apos;t want <unk> important . The point is , I was right . Your decision . Okay ? I was right . Your decision .
Right . I guess , I guess I should call Emily .
Okay , no , that &apos;s not the right decision . That &apos;s not , that &apos;s not right , no Ross-Ross , come on ! I mean , that woman made you miserable ! Okay , Ross , do you really want to get back into that ?
Okay , look , yesterday I would &apos;ve even considered calling her back , but my ex-wife calls on the same day I have a near death experience . I mean , that-that has got to mean something !
Ugh , Ross ! That was not a near death experience ! That was barely an experience !
You weren &apos;t there ! Okay , maybe this is something that I-I &apos;m supposed to seize ! Y &apos;know ?
Okay , y &apos;know what ? Maybe , this is not about <unk> stuff . Maybe this is about <unk> stuff .
Huh .
I mean , look-look today you <unk> death , y &apos;know ? And maybe this is a chance for you to <unk> getting back together with Emily ?
That does make sense . Because I do wanna seize some opportunity , but I-I really don &apos;t wanna see or talk to her .
Well , there you go !
Yeah . Maybe today is just , close call day .
Close call day .
Hey , thanks Rach .
Ohh , honey no problem . Okay .
Oh wait-wait-wait ! The message is blinking . Maybe you didn &apos;t erase it .
Oh ?
&quot; Hey Ross , it &apos;s you ! &quot; Oh yeah , no that &apos;s-that &apos;s an old message , nobody needs to hear that .
No .
Hey umm , was-was Monica here ?
Yeah .
Yeah , I want my money back .
Yeah , uh you-you probably need that for stamps , right ?
Hey Pheebs , has Gary ever been shot at for real ?
Yes . Once . Yeah , a little . He kinda did it to himself . It &apos;s not really a good story .
I wonder how I would react under fire , y &apos;know ? And not backfire but-but heavy fire , like I was in a war or something .
Man , I would be great in a war ! I mean , I really , I think I would make a fantastic <unk> <unk> . I mean I know I would make General way before any of you guys .
Before or after you were shot by your own <unk> ?
I know where Joey would be . He would be down in the <unk> <unk> all of us .
Yes , if the <unk> was <unk> with sandwiches .
Yeah , hero sandwiches .
Well you all know that I &apos;m a <unk> so I &apos;m not interested in war in any way . But y &apos;know what ? When the revolution comes , I will have to destroy you all . Not you Joey .
Would you like some more coffee , <unk> ?
I &apos;m fine , thanks .
Yeah , see , I can &apos;t pull of <unk> can I ?
No . I think we learned that from the <unk> incident . I &apos;m gonna get some tea .
Okay .
Hiya doin &apos; <unk> ?
Nope .
So it looks like it &apos;s going really well for you two , huh ?
I know , really well . In fact , I &apos;m gonna ask Phoebe to move in with me .
Oh my God !
What do you , what do you think ?
I think that is so great ! When are you gonna ask her ?
Tonight , but don &apos;t say anything . Okay ?
I swear , I promise . I promise . Oh my God , I &apos;m so excited ! { And I just can &apos;t hide it ! I &apos;m about to lose control and I think I like it ! Sorry , just couldn &apos;t resist it . } All right , listen let me tell you , do not get her flowers . Okay ? Because y &apos;know , she <unk> when they die , and there &apos;s the whole <unk> ...
I &apos;ll see you after work sweetie .
Okay . Bye !
So , what movie should we see ?
Gary &apos;s gonna ask you to move in with him ! !
What ? ! Really ? !
He just told me at the counter . He made me promise not to tell , but I couldn &apos;t hold it in any longer !
I can &apos;t believe this !
Right , because it &apos;s fast . Because , it &apos;s so fast . It &apos;s fast !
Relax ! It &apos;s Phoebe ! Not you !
Oh ! Good for you Pheebs , way to go !
No , but it is fast . Isn &apos;t it ?
Ohhhh !
No , I like him a lot but I don &apos;t think I &apos;m ready for this !
So , what are you gonna do ?
I don &apos;t know . I &apos;ll just handle <unk> &apos;ll ask you to talk to him !
Me ? ! Why me ?
Because you are so afraid of commitment ! You talk to him , make him scared like you ! Make him a ... man !
I &apos;ll try , but I &apos;m not sure what good it would do , y &apos;know ? Because I &apos;m a lot less afraid of commitment than I used to be .
That is so sweet !
Still <unk> , I &apos;ll take care of it . No problem .
Hey Ross , is uh , is Staten Island really an island ?
Uh-huh , that &apos;s why they call it Staten Island .
Ohhh . I thought it was like Long Island .
Also an island .
Hey , what time is it ?
2 : 17 .
Wow ! You realize that we &apos;ve been throwing this ball , without dropping it , for like an hour ?
Are you serious ? !
Yeah . I realized it about a half-hour ago but I didn &apos;t want to say anything &apos; cause I didn &apos;t want to <unk> it .
Wow ! We are pretty good at this ! Hey ! We totally forgot about lunch !
Oh , I-I , I think that &apos;s the first time I ever missed a meal ! Yeah , my pants are a little loose !
Hey , you guys ...
Hey !
Is Monica here ?
No .
All right listen umm , I just bought something I &apos;m not sure she &apos;s gonna like it , and it &apos;s gonna seem a little crazy , but this is something that I wanted since I was a little girl .
You bought <unk> <unk> !
Noo ! I wish ! Okay , you ready ?
Yeah !
Okay ! Check it out !
What-what is it ? !
What the hell is that ? ! !
It &apos;s a , it &apos;s a cat !
That , is not a cat ! { I have to agree with Joey on this one . }
Yes it is !
Why is it inside out ? !
Excuse me ! But this is a <unk> , <unk> <unk> cat !
How much did you pay for that ?
Well , it was a little <unk> , but I a pretty good deal .
Yeah ? How much ?
A thousand bucks .
<unk> A <unk> ? ? ! ! ! !
It &apos;s not a cat !
All right listen ball boys ! My grandmother had one of these when I was a little girl and it was the sweetest thing ! I mean it was so cute , it would sit in my lap and <unk> all day long , and I would drag a <unk> on the ground and he would chase it !
<unk> cats do that too , y &apos;know . { Which reminds me , if I might get a little political here , support your local animal shelter . <unk> <unk> are not the place to buy dogs and cats from , you get a much better deal from the shelter , plus they probably won &apos;t die on you in a week and a half . If you want a <unk> , go to the pet shop . If you want the dog for that <unk> , go to the shelter and save it &apos;s life . Now back to regularly scheduled programming . }
It &apos;s not a cat !
Ugh ! Look you guys , I &apos;m really excited about this ! Okay ? I don &apos;t care what you think ! I &apos;m gonna go set up a little litter box for Mrs. <unk> . Well , what am I gonna call her ? <unk> ? !
Hey , you wanna get something to eat or uh , do you wanna see how long we can throw this ball back and forth ? Huh ?
Uhh , the ball thing .
Yeah ?
Hey Ross , wouldn &apos;t it be great if we could go two straight hours without dropping it ? !
Uhh , yeah it would ! Let &apos;s do it !
Okay !
Uh-oh .
What ?
I have to pee . And Rachel &apos;s in the bathroom !
Man , I didn &apos;t think we were gonna make it !
I know ! Don &apos;t switch hands , okay ?
Hey ladies ! What are you in here for ?
Hey Chandler , what are you doing here ?
Gary , I &apos;m here to report a crime .
Yeah ?
It is a crime that you and I don &apos;t spend more time together .
What &apos;s up ?
Well , I heard that you thinking about asking Phoebe to move in with you and I thought maybe , we should have a talk . Man to uh , me .
Sure . Okay .
Uh , are you crazy ? Are you insane ? If you live with Phoebe , you two are gonna be y &apos;know , <unk> together !
Yeah , I-I considered that . I just know it would make me happy .
You mean scared .
No , I mean happy .
<unk> ? Happy ?
Chandler , what-what are you doing ?
I am trying to open your eyes , my man ! Don &apos;t you see , if you lived with Phoebe she &apos;s always gonna be there . You &apos;re gonna get home , she &apos;s there . You go to bed , she &apos;s there . You wake up and oh yes , she &apos;s there !
I know ! I can &apos;t wait !
Were you &apos;re parents happy , or something ?
Listen Chandler , the way I see it is that I was lucky enough to find someone that I really love . I just-I wanna be around her as much as I can .
Wow , y &apos;know when you say it , it doesn &apos;t sound so scary .
So you know what I &apos;m talking about , right ?
Yeah , I think I do ! Y &apos;know what ? You move in with her ! You move in with her right now ! Maybe I should in with Monica !
No , it &apos;s too soon for you guys .
Yeah , you &apos;re right about that .
... now when they found the remains of the <unk> <unk> they discovered what <unk> to be the remains of a <unk> <unk> in its <unk> ! How did it get there ? !
Maybe this should be more of a quiet game .
Hey guys !
Hi !
Joey , I left my watch on the counter last night . It was right here , where is it ?
I don &apos;t know .
All right , come on , I &apos;m-I &apos;m late for work !
How do you know ? You don &apos;t have a watch .
Guys , could you please just stop throwing the ball for one minute and just help me find it !
Oh , I don &apos;t know .... Yeah , can &apos;t do it .
What ? !
Monica , whatever you do , do not drop that ball !
Yeah , we haven &apos;t dropped it in ...
2 hours , 27 minutes .
Really ? !
I-I &apos;m not gonna be able to make it into work today , I don &apos;t feel very good . Yes ! ! Wow ! Uh , for a second there I thought I was really better , but I &apos;m not .
Hey Rach !
Hey .
Check it out ! Almost 3 hours without <unk> &apos; it !
Oh , wow ! Congratulations , that &apos;s quite a waste of time .
Rach ?
Yeah ?
You have <unk> all over you , what happened ?
Well , it &apos;s my cat .
What ? !
Oh yeah , I got a cat .
I don &apos;t want a cat !
Oh , don &apos;t worry , it &apos;s not a cat .
Yeah .
You guys this cat is nothing like my grandmother &apos;s cat . I mean , it &apos;s not sweet , it &apos;s not cute , I even dragged that little <unk> on the ground , and it just flipped out and scratched the hell out of me . And I swear , I know this sounds crazy , but every time this cat <unk> at me I know it &apos;s saying , &quot; Rachel ! &quot;
Doesn &apos;t sound as crazy as paying a thousand dollars for a cat .
What ? ! You paid a thousand dollars for a cat when you owe me 300 ! !
Well , I was gonna let you play with it .
Hi !
Hmm , did you talk to Gary about the moving in thing ?
Yes I did , and I think you should do it .
What ? !
He &apos;s a great guy , y &apos;know ? And he loves you a lot , you are a very lucky lady .
You are <unk> ! <unk> out about commitment is the one thing you can do ! The one thing ! And you can &apos;t even do that right ! God !
I &apos;m sorry . If you ask me , I &apos;d move in with him .
Ohh ! ! God ! Ooh ! Get out of here , good for nothing .
Hey Chandler .
Hey <unk> !
Hi sweetie . Hi , can I talk to you for a second ?
Yeah ! Okay .
You look very pretty today .
Thanks ! Okay .
Here &apos;s the thing .
Yeah ?
Y &apos;know I really want to move this relationship forward .
Uh-hmm .
Because if you &apos;re not moving forward , y &apos;know you &apos;re just moving backwards .
No that &apos;s not true . If you &apos;re not moving forward , you &apos;re just staying still . And staying still is good . Watch this .
Phoebe ?
Yeah ?
I want you to move in with me .
That is so sweet . But don &apos;t you think it &apos;s a little too soon ? I mean there &apos;s so much we don &apos;t know about each other .
Oh . Oh-oh-okay , I get it .
I just-I don &apos;t want us to jump into something we &apos;re not ready for .
Uh-huh .
I really don &apos;t want to mess up what we have . I &apos;m just-I &apos;m worried it &apos;s gonna be a big mistake .
Yeah .
Which is why my answer is yes !
Really ? !
Uh-huh ! I &apos;m so ... happy .
Monica ! Stop throwing it so hard ! We &apos;re on the same team !
Four hours ? You guys have been doing this for four hours ?
That &apos;s right baby .
All right , let me in .
No-no ! Don &apos;t do it ! Don &apos;t !
What ?
He &apos;s a dropper !
Oh yeah , that &apos;s right !
I &apos;m not a dropper !
It &apos;s really a uh-uh three person game , y &apos;know ?
It &apos;s throwing and catching !
All right .
Oh ! Oh ! That &apos;s so hard .
Whoa-whoa you guys , it &apos;s not a cat !
Oh <unk> good God !
I give up you guys , I don &apos;t know what I &apos;m going to do with this thing !
<unk> it didn &apos;t help , huh ?
So , why don &apos;t you just take it back to where you got it ?
I tried ! They won &apos;t take her back .
Maybe that &apos;s because she &apos;s a <unk> of the <unk> .
Rach , why won &apos;t they take it back ?
Well , they said would but they would only give me store credit . I mean , what am I going to do , get a thousand regular cats ?
Look , if you want you can keep it at our place until you find out what to do with it .
No Mon that &apos;s not the point . I &apos;m out a thousand dollars , I &apos;m all scratched up , and I &apos;m stuck with this stupid cat that looks like a hand !
Oh my God , the cat &apos;s made my eyes water ! Don &apos;t-don &apos;t throw it to me ! My vision &apos;s been <unk> ! ! Oh God ! Okay . Okay . It &apos;s okay . Man , that was close .
Yeah , you almost <unk> to something .

Congratulations ! <unk> !
I know , I &apos;m so excited !
So am I !
Well , you &apos;re not more excited than I am ! No way ! I &apos;m the most excited !
Okay , I &apos;ll see you at the station later .
Okay , yeah , I &apos;ll see you later ! Don &apos;t forget about the moving in !
All right .
So you &apos;re moving in with him . What happened ?
I couldn &apos;t tell him no . He got so sad . Maybe it &apos;ll be all right . I do really like him a lot and probably do it eventually anyway and plus , think of all the money I &apos;ll save on stamps .
Why , do you write him a lot ?
No , I just heard when people live together , they split the cost of stamps . Don &apos;t they ?
Yeah ! That &apos;s right . Yeah-yeah ! Yeah !
Oh , I &apos;m sorry , the <unk> <unk> really freaked me out .
Hey , honey ! Okay , so did you find any apartments ? Anything in Brooklyn Heights ?
No , nothing .
Oh really ?
Yeah .
Nothing at all ?
No , as soon as something <unk> up we &apos;ll move right in . Unless it doesn &apos;t have a pool , I need a pool .
Phoebe , can I talk to you for a second ?
Uh-huh !
Take a seat . You okay ? You feeling all right ?
Yeah , I feel great . &apos; Cause we &apos;re moving in together .

Let me tell you what I think might be going on . No-no-no , don &apos;t look at the table . Look at me . Okay , I think somebody asked someone to move in with them . And I think someone said , &quot; Yes &quot; but now she &apos;s having <unk> because things are moving to fast for someone . Does that sound at all possible to you ?
Yes . Yes ! Fine ! I am someone ! You want me to say it ? I have <unk> ! I &apos;m sorry !
Phoebe ...
Yeah ?
Phoebe , it &apos;s okay that you feel this way . I mean it is soon . And there &apos;s a lot of things we don &apos;t know about each other , and I just figure that everything I really like . And the things I don &apos;t know , I get to learn about at <unk> with both our names on the <unk> .
That &apos;s so sweet .
<unk> , but none of that matters if it &apos;s too soon for you . It &apos;s fine ! We don &apos;t have to move in together . I just-I want you to be happy
Living with you would make me happy .
Phoebe , you don &apos;t have to say that .
No , I really wanna live with you ! I wanna move in with you !

Oh , terrific ! That &apos;ll be $ 2,000 .
What ? !
Okay , a thousand .
I thought you wanted to <unk> your cat .
Well , I do , but you &apos;re just gonna have to actually look at this as more of an <unk> than a cat .
Okay , yeah , I just wanted a cat .
Obviously you know how to <unk> , so I &apos;m not gonna try and take you on . Okay ? So $ 800 and I don &apos;t call the <unk> because you &apos;re robbing me blind ! <unk> !

That game should not be played without my <unk> .

All I said was that uh , I didn &apos;t think this wasn &apos;t gonna be his big break , that this movie wasn &apos;t going to do anything for him , and that uh , y &apos;know it didn &apos;t sound like a real <unk> , he should &apos;ve pushed me off of the bridge .
What &apos;s in the bag ?
Oh , I figured you guys would all be mad at me . So I got you some gifts that I found on the side of the road . Who wants the teddy bear with one leg ?
I do !

Y &apos;know , he won &apos;t even talk to me . How am I going to apologize to him if he won &apos;t even talk to me ?
Well , maybe you should send him something . So that when he gets to Las Vegas he &apos;ll know that you &apos;re sorry .
That &apos;s a good idea . I wonder where I could get a basket of porn ...
No , don &apos;t-don &apos;t say I &apos;m sorry with porn !
Really ?
Y &apos;know what you should send him ? A cartoon of <unk> . &apos; Cause that why he could trade it for protection . No . That &apos;s prison .

That is so weird ! I had a dream that you &apos;d have lunch with Richard .
Really ?
But again , Simmons . Go on .
The strange part was , he was really nice , umm and he looks great , but I didn &apos;t feel anything at all !

Oh ! I remember laughing ! I laughed a lot .
And we didn &apos;t have sex .
Ohh , I mean , we were really drunk . I &apos;m just glad we didn &apos;t do anything stupid .
Tell me about it .
Mornin &apos; Pheebs . Well , my movie has officially been <unk> .
Oh Joey , I &apos;m so sorry . You want some of my breakfast ?
Nah , I &apos;m too depressed to eat . I &apos;ll probably eat in like 5 minutes . So I guess I &apos;ll just fly home with you guys , what time &apos;s your flight ?
What about my cab ?
I don &apos;t need that anymore .
No , Joey ! You borrowed my cab ; you have to drive it back .
I don &apos;t want to drive all the way back by myself , I get so lonely . <unk> ! How about you come with me ?
I don &apos;t know , it &apos;s such a long trip .
It &apos;ll be great ! We-we could talk , and play games ! Huh ? This could be our chance to like <unk> our friendship .
Are you asking me to have a <unk> ?
Sure ?
All right . Although I don &apos;t think we need one , I never stopped loving you .
Hi !
Hey .
Hey .
So , has anyone talked to Dr. and Mrs. Geller yet ?
Um-hmm , yeah . They left me a message ; they should be here any minute .
Where is the waitress ? ! I &apos;m starving !
It &apos;s a <unk> man .
Oh , here &apos;s where I win all my money back !
Listen , I gotta talk to you .
Sure ! What &apos;s up ?
Monica and I almost got married last night .
Oh my God ! That &apos;s huge ! Wait a minute , why come I wasn &apos;t invited ? And who was going to be your best man ? Don &apos;t say , &quot; Ross . &quot; Do not say , &quot; Ross . &quot;
Look , I just don &apos;t think Monica and I are ready to get married yet ! Y &apos;know ? I mean , I love her and everything but seeing Ross and Rachel coming out of that chapel was like a , like a <unk> call that Monica and I are moving so fast . Y &apos;know ? And , how do I tell her without <unk> her ?
Oh ! Tell her she &apos;s not marriage material .
What ? !
<unk> say it to me all the time ! And believe me , if she &apos;s anything like me , she &apos;s just gonna be relieved .
How do I tell Chandler that it &apos;s too soon . It &apos;s gonna break his heart , he &apos;s not gonna think that I don &apos;t love him anymore .
Well you don &apos;t .
Yes I do !
Good ! Good ! I was just <unk> you .
Hi .
Oh hi ! Hi ! Y &apos;know , we were just talking about <unk> .
No , we were talking about tennis . <unk> is more believable .
Hey !
Hey !
Hey !
What ?
Are we gonna talk about what you guys did last night ? Or ...
I don &apos;t know . What do you mean last night ? Nothing , nothing uh , happened last night .
Yeah !
Uh-huh ! Ross invited us all to watch .
Rach ! We weren &apos;t gonna miss our friends getting married !
Who got married ? !
You did .
What ? ! Hello ! We didn &apos;t get married .
No , we didn &apos;t get married ! That &apos;s ridiculous !
<unk> remember being in a chapel .
Oh my God .
<unk> would not let us get married when we were that drunk !
No !
They let you get married when you &apos;re drunk ! Most people who get married in Vegas are drunk !
Hell , I &apos;m drunk right now ! What ? I can &apos;t have a <unk> with breakfast ? ! I &apos;m on vacation !
What are you guys gonna do ?
Well , I guess we just find a divorce lawyer ?
Well , I think , I think , Ross already has one . Now , this one &apos;s free , right ? Because you paid for the first two , so the third one &apos;s free .
<unk> it up , but the joke &apos;s on you . Because we don &apos;t need to get divorced , okay ? We we &apos;re just gonna get an annulment .
An annulment ? Ross ! I don &apos;t think surgery &apos;s the answer here .
Oh-oh , that &apos;s your thing .
What ?
You &apos;re thing . You &apos;re thing . Y &apos;know ? You &apos;re the guy who gets divorced .
Oh yeah !
No-no , that &apos;s-that &apos;s not my thing ! I do not love getting divorced !
Yes you do ! This is your third divorce ! You love divorce so much you &apos;re probably gonna marry it ! Then it won &apos;t work out and you &apos;re gonna have to divorce it , <unk> guy . I &apos;m so drunk .
So , what do you think we should do ?
I don &apos;t know . But I-I-I know I love you !
I know I love you !
So where are we on the whole going back to the place where they have all the marriages thing ? I love you .
That &apos;s a good question . Look umm , last night we let the <unk> decide . Maybe we should leave it up to fate again . I love you !
Yes , we don &apos;t get married unless there &apos;s a sign ! Okay , so say uh , say you roll another eight then there &apos;s a definite sign that we should get married .
All right , eight we get married , but 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 we don &apos;t get married .
Sounds great .
Okay .
Coming in , we got a <unk> ! <unk> please .
Ready ?
Ready !
Come on eight .
Yes , yes eight .
Eight ! Easy eight .
Wow ! I can &apos;t believe I actually <unk> an eight .
That was so unlikely . Well , let &apos;s get married ! I guess .
Wait a minute . That wasn &apos;t a hard eight ! Last night I <unk> a hard eight .
That &apos;s right ! It was the wrong kind of eight , no wedding ! Damnit !
I wanted it so bad ! Wanna go pack ?
Yeah . We &apos;re doing the right thing , right ?
Ohh , of course we are ! We left it up to fate . If we were supposed to get married there would be a <unk> sign .
Okay , you have 19 questions left . Use them <unk> . Come on Joey ! You can &apos;t win if you don &apos;t ask any <unk> ! ! !

Okay , look , how is this gonna <unk> you ? Really ? I mean you fill some form out once and a while and instead of checking the box that says <unk> you check the box that says Mrs. ! It &apos;s right next to it !
Ohh , okay , I &apos;m sorry . You &apos;re right . Y &apos;know what ? We absolutely can stay married , because I was under the impression that the boxes were far away from each other . All right , look , just please , take a moment here and think about what you &apos;re asking of me .

Ross , it &apos;s not that big a deal ! So you &apos;ll been divorced three times , you &apos;ll still have a life , you &apos;ll go on dates ...
No ! No , I won &apos;t ! I &apos;ll be at the bottom of the dating barrel now . The only guys <unk> me will be Four <unk> Guy uh , <unk> Guy , and-and , <unk> .
Ross , you &apos;re being ridiculous ! Okay ? You are cute and smart and sweet and that is much more important than three stupid divorces !
Oh yeah ? Have you ever dated anyone who has been divorced three times ?
Y &apos;know that &apos;s really fair . Y &apos;know ? Most guys who have been divorced three times are like 60 . Ross , nobody cares about this except you ! This-this embarrassment thing is all in your head ! Here , I &apos;ll show you ! Come here .
What ? ! Why ?
Hi ! Hi ! Listen , my friend Ross is about to be divorced for the third time , but wouldn &apos;t you date him ?
And if you wait right here , I &apos;ll go get Ross .
Hey !
Ugh , I thought you were Rachel !

Okay , so that &apos;s it , everybody knows ! It &apos;s official , we &apos;re moving in together . No turning back . Are ya scared ? Are ya ?
No .
Wow that was my scariest voice ! You &apos;re very brave .
Hey !
Hey .
Ugh , the worse day ! Y &apos;know , you think you &apos;re making <unk> at work and then your boss calls you Raquel .
Hey listen , for the first four years of my work everybody called me <unk> . Seriously .
I believe you . So , it was right in the middle of a <unk> meeting so of course no one else wants to correct her so everyone else is calling me Raquel ! By the end of the day , the <unk> guys were calling me <unk> !
Well , I-I still think you &apos;re <unk> nice and very pretty ...
What ?
All yours babe .
Have a seat . Okay , listen umm , Chandler and I are going to live together , here .
Oh my God ! That &apos;s so great ! I &apos;m so happy for you guys !
Really ? !
And that was so sweet of you to ask ! Oh my God , the three of us are gonna have such a good time living together !
Yes , we are .
And Chandler , you &apos;re gonna have to watch those long showers you take in the morning because you know Raquel can &apos;t be late .
Rach ...
Yeah , he &apos;s gonna work on that .
Ohh ! This is so exciting ! Oh God ... Come and knock on my door ...
We &apos;ll be waiting for you ...
... once you know the stories , it &apos;s not that bad . First marriage , wife &apos;s hidden <unk> , not my fault . Second marriage , said the wrong name at the altar , a little my fault . Third marriage , well they really shouldn &apos;t <unk> you to get married when you &apos;re that drunk and have writing all over your face , <unk> &apos;s fault .
Okay , so what do you think ladies ? Who wouldn &apos;t be interested ? Who wouldn &apos;t want to date him ?
Well the divorces don &apos;t bother me , I &apos;d date him . But , not while he &apos;s still married .
Okay , what about you ? Wouldn &apos;t you want a date ?
Actually , I &apos;m dating at all anymore . See , I figured out that I was only dating guys that were like y &apos;know bad for me , so until I work that out ...
Whatever ! What about you Meg ?
Well , I don &apos;t care about the divorces either , but I wouldn &apos;t date him . It &apos;s just that he &apos;s obviously still in love with this Rachel girl .
What ? !
She said , &quot; He &apos;s obviously still in love with this Rachel girl . &quot;
This is crazy ! I mean , <unk> Rachel is my good friend and I-I have loved her in the past , but now , she is just my wife ! Phoebe , will <unk> you help me out here ?
Well , I thought you loved her when <unk> you married her .
We were drunk ! I would &apos;ve married uh , Joey with that amount of alcohol !
Hey ! You could do a lot worse than Joey Tribbiani ! !
Look , I &apos;m sorry , but you guys are wrong . I just don &apos;t want to be divorced three times .
Yes , and now he &apos;s using this three divorces reason because he wants to stay married to her because he loves her . I must say , &quot; Well done ! &quot; <unk> Meg .
Okay ! Fine ! Fine ! If-if this is what you think , forget about the whole three divorce thing ! Okay , I-I &apos;ll go to my lawyer &apos;s office right now and get this marriage annulled ! Okay ? ! Because she means nothing to me ! <unk> ! !
Okay now I wouldn &apos;t date you because you seem a little creepy .
I am so attracted to him right now .
Okay , when are we gonna tell Rachel what is actually gonna happen ?
<unk> ! I-I just couldn &apos;t before . You saw how upset Joey got ! I couldn &apos;t do that to her , she &apos;s my best friend !
Well , Joey &apos;s my best friend .
I &apos;m not your best friend ?
You just said ... Of course you &apos;re my best friend . Would you please tell Rachel though ?
All right , all right , at least I &apos;m prepared .
Okay . Oh yes .
Hey !
Hey-hey !
These aren &apos;t for you ! Are you upset ?
I am now !
Hey roomie !
Okay , bye !
Rach , there &apos;s something uh , important I have to tell you .
Are you pregnant ? !
No ! But , I &apos;m throwing this shirt away ! I think there was a little misunderstanding before .
Um-hmm .
Umm , when I said that uh , that Chandler and I wanted to umm , live together we meant alone together .
Oh my God ! Oh , that &apos;s funny , I can &apos;t believe I did that .
Oh no sweetie , no ! This is my fault , I wasn &apos;t clear ! I &apos;m really sorry . And listen , you take as much time as you need to move out okay ? There &apos;s absolutely no rush .
Okay .
Okay . Don &apos;t you want a cookie ?
Sure ? Thanks .
Maybe , do you need a tissue ?
Monica , where did you get these ? !
I made them !
Ooh , good God , they &apos;re so yummy !
God , it &apos;s gonna so weird like when I come home and you &apos;re not here . Y &apos;know ? No more Joey and Chan &apos;s . No more <unk> and C &apos;s . &quot; You wanna go over to Joey and Chandler &apos;s ? &quot; &quot; Can &apos;t , its not there . &quot;
Look , I &apos;m just gonna be across the hall , we can still do all the same stuff .
Yeah but we won &apos;t be able to like get up in the middle of the night and have those long talks about our feelings and the future .
Not once did we do that .
Hi .
Hey !
Hi .
So I , I told Rachel it was just gonna be the two of us .
Oh yeah ? Well , how &apos;d she take it ?
Really well . Yeah . <unk> well . Yeah , she didn &apos;t cry . She wasn &apos;t angry or sad .
And you &apos;re upset because you didn &apos;t make your best friend cry ?
I mean , all I &apos;m asking for is just a little <unk> ! Is that too much to ask after six years ? ! I mean what ? <unk> Rachel and I not as close as you guys ? ! I mean do we not have as much fun ? ! Don &apos;t I deserve a few tears ? ! ! I mean we-we told Joey , he cried his eyes out !
Hey ! I did not cry my eyes out ! ! Come on ! It &apos;s like the end of an era ! No more <unk> and <unk> &apos;s ! !
Okay , I gotta ask , who calls us that ? !
You got married again .
Yes .
So that &apos;s your second marriage in two years .
Yes , second in two years . Third <unk> .
Ross , I have been a divorce <unk> for 23 years and never had I so much business from one client . Why don &apos;t you tell me what happened .
<unk> , Rachel and I were in Vegas and we got drunk ...
I &apos;m sorry , is this the same Rachel who &apos;s name you said at the altar in the second marriage ?
<unk> ! But , I-I do not love her .
Oh , that &apos;s better then .
This was just a drunken mistake and I need to get it annulled .
I see . Have you considered therapy ?
I think just the annulment for today .
There are a couple of forms to fill out .
Easy .
And we &apos;ll need to have witnesses who can <unk> that you were not of uh , sound mind .
No problem .
And we &apos;ll need you and Rachel to <unk> before a judge .
Ooh ! There &apos;s no way to do this without her ? &apos; Cause I kinda all ready told her uh , it was , it was already taken care of .
Of course you did . Look Ross , you can &apos;t get an annulment unless you and Rachel are both there .
<unk> , what about someone who looks like Rachel ? I will think about the therapy .
Hey !
Hey . So um , I was thinking that maybe we should start <unk> up our stuff .
Okay !
Y &apos;know , no point in <unk> it out . <unk> out the long <unk> of you moving out and us not living together anymore .
Okay .
Hey Rach , what about this ? Huh ? Who-who gets this ? See , I don &apos;t know if I want it because it might be y &apos;know , too many memories !
What the hell is that ?
I don &apos;t know . Hey , Rachel , you want the big plate ? I want you to have the big plate .
Wow ! Mon , thanks ! I love this plate !
Something to remember me by !
Mon , honey you &apos;re not dying . I &apos;m just moving out . Y &apos;know , I mean we &apos;re gonna see each other all the time .
But still , it &apos;s a big change . The end of an era , you might say !
Are you okay ? You &apos;re not blinking .
I &apos;m fine ! I just , I &apos;m thinking how much it &apos;s an end of era .
Oh , all right . But y &apos;know I gotta say , I don &apos;t , I don &apos;t think six years counts as an era .
An era is <unk> as a significant period of time . Now , it was significant to me , maybe it wasn &apos;t significant to you !
What is the matter with you ? !
What is the matter with you ? ! ! Why aren &apos;t you more upset ? ! Aren &apos;t you gonna be sad that we &apos;re not gonna be living together anymore ? ! I mean aren &apos;t you gonna miss me at all ? !
All right , fine , but don &apos;t get mad at me . It &apos;s-it &apos;s just a little hard to believe .
What &apos;s hard to believe ?
Well y &apos;know , it &apos;s you guys . You-you do this kind of stuff ! Y &apos;know ? I mean , you-you were gonna get married in Vegas and then you backed out ! I guess I &apos;m not upset because I don &apos;t see you guys going through with it . I &apos;m sorry .
Rachel , it &apos;s going to happen . Chandler is gonna move in here .
But I ...
No-no , wait ! Just let me finish , okay ? This isn &apos;t something that we just , we just <unk> decided in-in Vegas , this is something we both really want . And it is going to happen .
It is ? Really ?
Yeah , sweetie .
I mean we &apos;re not , we &apos;re not gonna live together anymore ?
No .
What ? Oh my God ! I &apos;m gonna miss you so much !
I &apos;m gonna miss you !
I mean it &apos;s the end of an era !
I know !
Okay , bye !
Oh no .
So ? Did you get the annulment ?
I couldn &apos;t .
I knew it ! Because you love Rachel .
It &apos;s not that . Okay ? <unk> are more complicated than I ...
Yeah , complicated &apos; cause of the love .
I ... I do , I do not love Rachel . I &apos;m gonna tell her right now about the whole thing so we can get this marriage annulled as fast as possible . Okay ? Would I do that if I loved her ?
I &apos;ve never been more convinced of your love for her .
I do not have feelings for Rachel ! Okay ? !
Ohh , what &apos;s wrong ? !
Monica and Chandler are really moving in here and I have to move out and everything is changing .
Oh <unk> here ! Come here ! It &apos;s okay . Everything &apos;s gonna be okay .
Thank you .
Of course .
So , Ross and Rachel got married , Monica and Chandler almost got married , do you think you and I should hook up ?
Oh we do , but not just yet .
Really ? ! Well , when ?
Okay umm , well , first Chandler and Monica will get married and be <unk> rich by the way . Yeah . But it won &apos;t work out .
Wow .
I know . Then , I &apos;m gonna marry Chandler for the money and you &apos;ll marry Rachel and have the beautiful kids .
Great !
But then we <unk> those two and that &apos;s when we get married . We &apos;ll have Chandler &apos;s money and Rachel &apos;s kids and getting custody will be easy because of Rachel &apos;s drinking problem .
Oh-oh , what about Ross ?
I don &apos;t want to go into the whole thing , but umm , we have words and I kill him .
Hey !
Hey ! Check it out ! This is unbelievable ! Joey has been holding his breath for almost four minutes !
Dude ! What are <unk> trying to kill me ? !
Pheebs , I wanna ask you something .
Uh-huh , what ?
Well since I &apos;m <unk> &apos; out and-and you &apos;re so beautiful ...
Oh !
... how about I move in with you ?
Well , that would be great but then what do we do about Denise ?
Who &apos;s Denise ?
My roommate .
You have a roommate ? !
Yes , Denise . Denise !
Hey , what is with the <unk> Phoebe ? Huh ? And what about this Denise , is she cute ?
Pheebs , I don &apos;t understand . How can you have a roommate that none of us know anything about ?
Maybe because you never listen to anything that I say . I talk about her all the time ! <unk> ! ! ! ! !
Hey Rach , listen I was thinkin &apos; uh , I &apos;m gonna have an extra room over at my place ...
Oh , that &apos;s true .
Yeah , why don &apos;t you move in with me ? It &apos;ll be great ! We could stay up late , watch movies , and you know about Naked Thursday &apos;s right ?
Yeah , yeah I think I &apos;m gonna find my own place .
Hey-hey ! I thought Naked Thursday &apos;s was just our thing man !
Hey .
Hey !
So , what did Rachel say when you told her you were still married to her ?
Oh , that . Umm , she took it really well .
You didn &apos;t tell her did you ?
No .
Of course not , because you &apos;re in love with her .
I am not in love with her . She was very upset about having to move out so I eh , didn &apos;t tell her we were still married because she would only get more upset . I-I just <unk> her , as a friend .
What do you mean , <unk> her ?
It &apos;s nothing , I just gave her a hug .
Ah-ha ! A classic sign of love , the hug !
It &apos;s also a sign of friendship .
Yeah , not in your case <unk> <unk> .
It was a hug !
Okay , just tell me this , did you or did you not smell her hair ?
<unk> her hair ? What if I did ?
<unk> percent of a women &apos;s <unk> come out the top of her head ! That &apos;s why , that &apos;s why women are shorter . So that men will fall in love when they hug them ! Oh come on Ross , you &apos;re a scientist .
I was <unk> her as a friend . It &apos;s not my fault <unk> hair got in my face , she &apos;s got a lot of it and it smells <unk> uh ... <unk> . What ? ! Oh , that doesn &apos;t mean I have feelings for Rachel ! Maybe it means I have feelings for <unk> !
Okay , whatever you say . But just be careful , all right ? Rachel &apos;s not in the same place you are .
If the place you are referring too is being in love , then she is in the same place as me because I am not in that place !
Okay , I didn &apos;t understand that , but y &apos;know , maybe that &apos;s &apos; cause you were speaking the secret language of love !
Hey ! Dude , some guy just called for you .
Who was it ?
I don &apos;t know ! How about , &quot; Thanks for taking the message . &quot; Jeez !
Okay listen , y &apos;know when you move in Rachel &apos;s room is gonna be empty , you wanna talk about what we want to do with it ?
Sure !
Okay , I was thinking we should have a beautiful guest room , right ? With a <unk> <unk> bed and <unk> tables with flowers on them all the time ! And we could have a roll top desk with comment cards on them so people could say how much they loved staying here ! ! Okay , whatever , I really haven &apos;t thought about it that much .
Well , I like that idea . Obviously ! I was thinking <unk> it could be a game room , y &apos;know ? I mean you can buy old arcade games like uh , like <unk> <unk> and <unk> for $ 200 , the real ones ! The big-big ones !
No .
Okay so you mean no as in , &quot; Gee Chandler , what an interesting idea . Let &apos;s discuss it before we reject it completely . &quot;
Oh , I &apos;m sorry . Of course I mean that . Interesting idea , umm , talk about it , but no .
So , that &apos;s it ?
I just don &apos;t think arcade games go in the beautiful guest room . The beautiful guest room is gonna be filled with <unk> .
Which is why <unk> is perfect ! It &apos;s the <unk> game !
What do you have against the beautiful guest room ?
I don &apos;t have anything against the beautiful guest room , especially since everybody we know lives about 30 seconds away !
Are you <unk> me ?
No , I &apos;m not <unk> you , or you beautiful guest room .
Hey , what &apos;s up ?
Nothing , Monica and I had a stupid fight .
But you &apos;re still moving in together , right ? Because my ad came out today .
&quot; Wanted . <unk> roommate , non-smoker , <unk> . &quot; Nice !
Yeah ? I just figured y &apos;know , after living with you it &apos;d be an interesting change of <unk> to have a female roommate , y &apos;know ? Someone I can learn from , <unk> who &apos;s different than me . And what &apos;s more different than me ; a guy who &apos;s not 19 than say a girl who is 19 ? Enh ? Not just a hat <unk> my friend !
Pheebs , I have to ask you ...
<unk> ! I &apos;m <unk> right now .
You &apos;re just staring into space .
Umm , I &apos;m trying to move that pencil .
This one ?
It worked !
Pheebs , this whole apartment thing is just a nightmare ! Every place I can afford comes with a roommate who is a freak . I mean , look at this ; &quot; Wanted . <unk> roommate , non-smoker , <unk> . &quot; It &apos;s just , there is nothing ! The city &apos;s full !
Wait , no , look at this ! &quot; Two bedroom , two bath , must be non-smoker , Satan <unk> okay ... &quot; Oh , yeah , but it &apos;s on the ground floor .
Hey !
Hey .

Yeah ! Why ?
Okay , there &apos;s this guy , Warren , from the museum and he &apos;s going on a dig for like two years and he &apos;s got this great place he needs to <unk> . So uh , you interested ?
That sounds great ! I &apos;d love to live at Warren &apos;s ! ! I love Warren ! Thank you !

I don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
Umm , I &apos;m talking about that which you already know but won &apos;t admit . You love her again ; you <unk> her !
Look , I do not <unk> her .
I can &apos;t believe you won &apos;t just admit it ! Okay , just promise me that you won &apos;t do anything stupid .
Look , we &apos;re just friends now ! Okay ? Why would I do anything stupid ?
Ugh ! ! ! Well , the apartment is already <unk> ! I mean , this is just hopeless . I &apos;m never gonna find anything .
You can live with me .
What ? !

Oh my God ! Are you serious ? !
Uh-huh .
I would love to live with you Ross ; that &apos;s-that &apos;s great ! Thank you !
Well , I &apos;m-I &apos;m just glad I could , y &apos;know , help you out .
Wow ! I &apos;m-I &apos;m so happy for you guys . This is so-so , not stupid .
Ross-Ross , you have no idea what this means to me ! I mean , I mean I was gonna be <unk> . You just saved me ! You &apos;re my hero !
<unk> , I uh , I don &apos;t <unk> , all right .
Oh , I have to go tell Monica what a wonderful brother she has !
Oh please ! You &apos;re gonna say things now , aren &apos;t ya ?
No . No , I won &apos;t . But I should tell you this , this exact same thing happened to my roommate Denise . She moved in with a guy who was <unk> married to her and he said he didn &apos;t love her , but he really did , and it just blew up ! And that &apos;s how she ended up living with me ! Okay , that &apos;s a lie .
Hi .
Hi .
Hi , listen , I &apos;m sorry about before . I don &apos;t need to have a game room . I mean when I was a kid I only played those games because I couldn &apos;t get girls , and now I can &apos; <unk> , I have you . Not-not that I think that I have you or think of you as <unk> in any sort of way , I see women ...
Stop it Chandler . I &apos;m sorry too .
Really ?
Yeah ! Oh yes !
Ohh .
Listen , we don &apos;t have to make that a guest room , we can think of something to do with the room together .
That &apos;s a great idea ! We can easily think of a way for us both to enjoy the room .
Totally !
We don &apos;t have to come up with this now .
Oh good .
Hey , y &apos;know what ? Why don &apos;t we think about changes we can make in the living room ?
<unk> ?
Yeah , I mean we &apos;re gonna have to move around some furniture to make room for my chair .
You &apos;re-you &apos;re-you &apos;re gonna bring the <unk> <unk> over here ?
Is that a problem ?
Well , it &apos;s a set and they should probably stay together .
Oh , that &apos;s cool . Then I &apos;ll just bring them both over .
See now-now you &apos;re taking them away from their home .
Okay , I get it . So , I get nothing ! Nothing here is mine ! Everything here is yours ! I &apos;ll get up in the morning put on your clothes , and head off to work !
Yeah-yeah , y &apos;know what ? Yeah , that &apos;s <unk> &apos;s it , everything will be mine ! Nothing will be yours ! That &apos;s-that &apos;s what I said ! Oh come on , Chandler ! I &apos;m talking about the <unk> <unk> ! It just , it doesn &apos;t match ! Where is it gonna go ? !
In the game room !
Look it is not my fault that your chairs are incredibly ugly !
All right ! That &apos;s fine ! That &apos;s fine ! I won &apos;t bring over the chairs ! I won &apos;t bring anything over ! I wouldn &apos;t want to ruin the <unk> over here at Grandma &apos;s place ! !
Everything on your application looks really <unk> ! Just one last question umm , are you and your friends gonna be over here all the time like <unk> and hanging out ?
Oh don &apos;t worry , I &apos;m not really a party girl .
Whoa ! ! Now look , don &apos;t be just <unk> &apos; stuff out . I want you to really think about your answers . Okay ?
You can call off the roommate search ! Hi ! I &apos;ll be living here .
Oh don &apos;t listen to him , he &apos;s just some guy who really wants the apartment , but I don &apos;t think he &apos;s gonna get it .
Why did you take the shower curtain down ?
That thing was a <unk> ! I &apos;m very safety <unk> .
Hey !
Hey ! Oh listen , I was just clearing some space for your stuff .
Oh thanks , but listen , I was just at Monica &apos;s and she and Chandler had a big fight and they &apos;re not moving in .
What do you mean , they &apos;re not moving in ? They-they &apos;re still moving in right ?
No-no , they just had a big <unk> over what to do with my room .
What ? ! Over a stupid room !
Yeah , I feel kinda bad for them , but I &apos;m also really psyched &apos; cause I don &apos;t have to move in here !
Oh no , yeah no , that part &apos;s great !
What &apos;s all this about you guys fighting ? ! Is this really over a room ? ! I mean , that is so silly !
Ross , we can handle this .
Well , apparently not , and I can &apos;t just stand by and watch two people I care about very much be hurt over something that is so silly . I mean , enough of the silliness !
Well , why don &apos;t you tell her to stop being silly !
Okay-okay ! Two very good points , look I &apos;ve known you both a long time , and I &apos;ve never seen either of you one / <unk> as happy as you &apos;ve been since you &apos;ve got together . Do you really want to throw that all away over a room ? That is so silly . Now wh-what is more important , love or silliness ?
Well , we are <unk> of the silliness , but we also have a soft spot for the love .
Love is the best medicine .
That &apos;s <unk> .
Why do you do it ?
I don &apos;t know .
Okay ! All right ! Now , Chandler you-you wanna live with Monica , right ?
Yeah , I do .
And Mon , you wanna live with Chandler , don &apos;t ya ?
Yes .
Good ! A verbal contract is <unk> in the state of New York !
So I understand you &apos;re looking for a place .
No-no , I &apos;m staying put .
Oh , I was going to offer you my apartment .
Why , where are you going ?
I don &apos;t know .
Hey Rach !
Hi !
You &apos;re never gonna believe it uh , Monica and Chandler are moving in again . That &apos;s great news <unk> mean for them . Right ?
Oh wow .
Yeah but , on the <unk> side , we get to be roommates again .
Yeah . Y &apos;know umm , uh , umm , about that , umm , Ross I really appreciate your offer to let me move in and everything , but don &apos;t you think it &apos;s gonna be weird ?
Wh-why ? ! <unk> would it , why would it be weird ?
Well , because of us ! Because of our history .
No !
No ?
No ! No ! It would be weird if we were still in that place , I mean are you still in that place ?
No ! Not at all !
Good ! Me neither ! So it &apos;s not a problem . We &apos;re just two friends who happen to be roommates .
Okay , but Ross , eventually you and I are gonna be dating .
Really ? ! We are ?
Yeah ! I &apos;m gonna have a boyfriend , you &apos;re gonna have a girlfriend ...
Ohh ! That would be great .
But y &apos;know what , if you think it &apos;s gonna be okay we &apos;ll just work out a system . Y &apos;know , it &apos;ll be like college , I &apos;ll hang a hanger on the door and put a sign , &quot; Come back later , I &apos;m gettin &apos; lucky . &quot;
Yeah , I didn &apos;t think of that .
So are you sure about this whole moving in thing ? ! I mean it &apos;s a really big step ! And-and what &apos;s the rush ? !
That &apos;s very funny !
He &apos;s being silly , because he knows that we enjoy the silliness !
No , I-I-I &apos;m serious , okay ? I mean , think about it . You move in , you start fighting over stupid game rooms , next thing y &apos;know you break up !
Ross , you were right before , it was just a stupid fight about a room .
Okay , there are no stupid fights ! ! This isn &apos;t about the room , this is about what the room ... <unk> ! And unfortunately , this room could destroy you ! !
Yeah , I &apos;m not so worried .
Yeah , no , me neither .
Fine ! It &apos;s your life ! I just don &apos;t want to see you guys break up ! Which you will do if you move in together , but that &apos;s what you want , there &apos;s nothing I can do . <unk> &apos;T <unk> IT ! ! ! ! !
You still want to move in together right ?
Of course !
Ross didn &apos;t scare you ?
<unk> me out of ever wanting to live with him .
Come here , I want to show you something !
Okay !
Oh my God ! Someone &apos;s killed Square Man !
This is where I thought the <unk> <unk> could go ! You see you could see the TV and it &apos;s still walking distance to the kitchen .
Oh that &apos;s so sweet ! I want to show you something too !
Okay !
Y &apos;know those big-big uh , road signs that say &quot; <unk> ? &quot;

Oh my God ! I love that !
Really ? !
Uh , no ! !
I found you in my bed ! How &apos;d you <unk> up there ? You are a <unk> ! Little black curly hair ! Little black curly hair ! Little black , little black , little black , little black , little black curly hair <unk>

Thank you . Now are you sure ? Because once I make a copy , there &apos;s no turning back .
Yeah , I &apos;m-I &apos;m sure . Yeah , get out of here before I change my mind .
Umm , listen , Ross do you really think this moving in with Rachel is a good idea ?
I &apos;ve been back and forth .
Yeah well , maybe you should go back ! Okay ? Rachel moves in , and before you know it you &apos;re right where you don &apos;t want to be ! Back together !
Ehh , I don &apos;t , I don &apos;t think so . She &apos;s already talked about y &apos;know , dating other guys .
That &apos;s not gonna work out ! Then she &apos;s gonna come home all <unk> and you &apos;ll be tellin &apos; her , &quot; Oh that &apos;s okay . You &apos;ll find someone . &quot; And then , bamn ! She finds you !
Yeah , well , <unk> you &apos;re right .

Whoa ! Whoa ! Whoa , Joey !
<unk> ... It &apos;s okay , I mean <unk> Rach , I know I scared you off with that whole Naked Thursday &apos;s thing , but we don &apos;t have to do that !

Thursday &apos;s clearly not good for ya , pick a day !
Hi !

This sounds like a hernia . You have <unk> go to the doctor !
No way ! &apos; Kay look , if I have to go to the doctor for anything it &apos;s gonna be for this thing sticking out of my stomach !
That &apos;s a hernia .
Why did I have to start working out again ? Damn you <unk> !

Hey !
Hey .
Hey !
What &apos;s going on ?
Oh Joey &apos;s got a really bad hernia , but that &apos;s nothing a little laser eye surgery won &apos;t fix !
Look , I &apos;m telling you if I put my hand on my stomach right here it doesn &apos;t hurt that bad .
Hey ! Maybe you &apos;ll die !
Sure , now I &apos;m scared .

Ross got married <unk> ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
All right , keep going . We are phasing the accent out , phasing it out . So without out <unk> the <unk> in the <unk> the team would never have <unk> the <unk> <unk> in their carbon dating <unk> . Were there any questions at this point ? Yes .

Come again ? What &apos;s-what &apos;s this nonsense ? All right , I &apos;m-I &apos;m not English . I &apos;m from Long Island . I was really nervous and the accent just uh , just came out . I &apos;m sorry . So , if we could just get back to the lecture . Umm , were there any questions ? About paleontology . All right , look I was just trying to make a good first impression . Obviously , I screwed up . But what you guys think of me is really important because I &apos;m-I &apos;m hoping to get a permanent job here . So if you just give me another chance to make a good impression ...
Ross ! ! Are you crazy ? ! I am still your wife ! ! What , were you just never gonna tell me ? ! ! What the hell is wrong with you ? ! ! ! ! Ugh , I could just kill you ! ! ! !

We &apos;re just celebrating that Joey got his health insurance back .
Oh , all right .

Look I was going to tell you !
When ? ! After the birth of our first secret child ? ! Ross didn &apos;t get the annulment ; we are still married .
What ?
You &apos;re kidding !
Oh my God ! !
Ross !
Okay , maybe it wasn &apos;t my best decision . But I just couldn &apos;t face another failed marriage .
Okay , let me just jump in and ask , at what point did you think this was a successful marriage ?
Rach , come on , if you think about it , it &apos;s actually kinda funny . Okay , maybe it &apos;s best not to think about it .
Okay , this is <unk> . I am <unk> to my very <unk> !
Phoebe , I told her you already knew .
Another lie . You have a sickness !
Ross , just for my own piece of mind , you &apos;re not married to anymore of us are ya ?
Oh ! Hey , somebody left their keys . <unk> , to a Porsche ! Hey Gunther , these yours ?
Yeah , that &apos;s what I drive . I make four bucks an hour , I saved up for <unk> years !

Joey , why don &apos;t you put them in the lost and found ?
There &apos;s a lost and found ? My shoe !
You left a shoe here ? !
Well , I didn &apos;t realize until I got home . I wasn &apos;t gonna walk all the way back down here with one shoe ! Y &apos;know what ? I &apos;m gonna go find that guy &apos;s car and leave a note on the <unk> .
Oh good , when he comes back for his keys , I &apos;ll be sure to give him your shoe .
Great ! Thanks .
Oh , good , good , you guys are here ! Listen , how would like to spend tomorrow taking care of three incredibly cute little puppies ? !
Oh my God , what a fun day ! That sounds great !
Yeah , all right .
Okay , well I &apos;ll bring them by tomorrow morning . Okay , and uh , by the way , they &apos;re not actually puppies , they &apos;re Frank and Alice &apos;s triplets . Okay , see ya !
Whoa-whoa-whoa ! What ?
Please ! Please ! Please ! Please ! Oh please ! Please ! Please ! Frank and Alice asked me to baby sit the triplets and I &apos;m nervous &apos; cause I &apos;ve never done that before by myself !
Don &apos;t worry about it Phoebe , we &apos;ll absolutely do it .
Yeah , I &apos;m gonna pass . &apos; Cause I was kinda <unk> when it was puppies .
Come on Chandler , come on ! It &apos;ll give us great practice for <unk> with babies come to visit .
Nice car !
Yeah , it &apos;s not mine .
I love your car .
Yeah , it &apos;s mine .
I bet it &apos;s fast .
Me too ! Yeah . And comfortable . Do uh , do you like leather seats ?
Yeah !
It &apos;s got &apos; em !
So , I still have boxes here . I still have boxes at Ross &apos;s , and I have nowhere to live ! Wow . I could so easily freak out right now .
What about me ? I just found out that Denise is leaving town for a while , I don &apos;t have a roommate .
Well , maybe-maybe I could be your roommate Pheebs .
Maybe you could be my roommate !
Well there &apos;s an idea ! !
Yeah !
That would be great ! Wait , how long is Denise gone for ?
Umm , she said she &apos;d be back December <unk> .
December <unk> , huh maybe she &apos;s Santa Clause .
Oh look who it is , my husband . The apple of my eye .
Okay , I got us a court date for tomorrow at 2 : 00 and I picked up all the forms . I &apos;ll take care of everything .
Well sure , if you say you &apos;re gonna take care of everything I have no reason to doubt you . Give me those forms ! All right , now I &apos;m gonna do this my way and I don &apos;t want to hear a peep out of you !
Okay Rach , but ...
Op ! You &apos;re <unk> !
Ross ! Y &apos;know what , I just <unk> ? Why did you do this ? !
Look I told you ...
I don &apos;t wanna hear &quot; Three failed marriages ! &quot;
Look , if you &apos;d had two failed marriages , you &apos;d understand !
Well , y &apos;know what ? Thanks to you I &apos;m half way there ! Ugh ! Oh ! I am so mad ! Ross , I don &apos;t think I have ever been this angry !
What about the time I said we were on a break ?
Ugh !
Pheebs , how &apos;s it going ?
I &apos;m doing okay . I think it &apos;s going well . Do you think they &apos;re having fun ? Am I talking to fast ?
Nope , sound like me . Pheebs , it &apos;s going great . Look at Chandler with little baby girl Chandler .
Little baby girl Chandler , where I have heard that before ? Oh right , <unk> <unk> . Do you know what Pheebs ? When you &apos;re done over there , we kinda have a situation over here too .
<unk> , no , we are all <unk> for our own babies .
See that &apos;s where I think that you &apos;re wrong . We &apos;ve been playing these babies man for man ; we should really be playing a zone defense .
What do you mean ?
I just think that things would go a lot <unk> if we each have our own zone . Phoebe , you can be in charge of <unk> . And y &apos;know Mon , you can be in charge of <unk> and I can be in charge of looking how cute they are when they put their hands around ...
That sounds really great , but maybe you should be in charge of <unk> .
Okay , I &apos;m a rookie . I should not be in the end zone .
This is so great ! This is exactly how we set the <unk> at the restaurant .
Yeah ? Well this is not what I ordered .
Hey guys !
Hey !
Hey !
Hey babies ! Oh , I &apos;m having the best morning . That uh , that Porsche I &apos;ve got the keys too , still there !
<unk> ! Since you still have the keys .
You should see the <unk> I get when I &apos;m with that car ! People are friendly ; they-they wanna talk , and not just about the car ! One guy gave me advice about my <unk> <unk> .
What <unk> <unk> ?
The ones that got me the Porsche ! Will you keep up ! But I figured , if-if people keep seeing me just standing there , they &apos;re gonna start to think that I don &apos;t own it . So I figured I &apos;ll wash it . Right ? Monica , you got a bucket and some soap I can borrow ?
Oh yeah , I got soap and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> wax and <unk> <unk> .
You don &apos;t even have a car !
I know . But umm , one time there was this really dirty car in front of the building , so I washed it .
And ?
And six others .
There you are .
Yeah , she <unk> out at <unk> .
Wow !
And that &apos;s just in the city . I get her up to <unk> when I take her upstate .
Really ! You got a place upstate ?
Sure !
Well , I &apos;ll see you later .
Okay , take it easy .
Hey ! That &apos;s my car .
Really ? Oh uh , oh just give me five more minutes with it .
What-what are you doing ?
Oh I-I uh , found the keys and now I &apos;m just <unk> her up .
But it &apos;s my car !
Yeah , but it &apos;s my wax .
Listen , I-I-I don &apos;t come to this city much so I don &apos;t know if you &apos;re crazy or this is some kind of street theater , but could I have my keys .
Sure . Here . I &apos;ll uh , save your parking spot .
I &apos;m not coming back .
Why not ?
I live upstate .
Yeah , so did I.
I don &apos;t know why I was so nervous about this . And I don &apos;t know why Frank and Alice are always <unk> . This is so easy .
Yeah , two hours , a lifetime that &apos;s the same .
Check it out ! Check it out ! When the babies wake up , they can meet Krog !
Chandler , what are you doing ? That thing can put someone &apos;s eye out !
He can do more than that ! He can destroy the universe !
No Chandler , they can swallow one of those little parts ! And also , look at his smooth area , that &apos;s just gonna mess them up .
They &apos;re not gonna swallow anything , you guys are being way over protective . When I was a kid , my mom used to just throw me into a <unk> of broken glass !
What ? !
Glass , sand , whatever .
Oh , look at little Leslie stretching in her sleep .
Oh it &apos;s so cute . I wonder what age it is when you stop being able to put both legs over your head .
Oh , I can still do that .
How are you still single ? !
All right . I thought about it and maybe you &apos;re right . Maybe Krog is not a safe toy .
Good . What made you change your mind ?
I <unk> the <unk> <unk> gun .
How did that happen ? ! !
Well , I was trying to prove that I was right . Y &apos;know ? And it turns out I was wrong . And now it &apos;s lodged in my throat .
Damnit ! Y &apos;know this whole time we were <unk> on watching the babies and , and no one was watching Chandler !
Okay you two are asking the court for an annulment ?
Yes your honor , and here are , are forms , all filled out .
So based on your <unk> you are <unk> an annulment on the <unk> that Mr. Geller is <unk> unstable .
Fine , I &apos;m <unk> unstable .
And based on the fact that Mr. Geller is <unk> drug <unk> .
What ? !
Uh yes , heroin and <unk> .
<unk> isn &apos;t even an <unk> drug !
Well , you would know .
Now it also says here that you lied about your sexual <unk> before marriage ?
Oh , come on !
Ross , please , I found the magazines !
And finally that you were <unk> to consummate the marriage . Well , that makes sense since you &apos;re gay and <unk> to heroin .
Okay , I &apos;m sorry , this is insane ! I-I-I &apos;m not <unk> to heroin , I &apos;m not gay , and there is no problem with my ability to consummate anything ! Look , I &apos;ll consummate this marriage right here , right now !
That won &apos;t be necessary .
And when we were dating we <unk> like bunnies !
Ugh !
Now if you were two involved in a serious relationship , that really <unk> a problem .
Ross ! Your honor , rest <unk> relationship ended like two years ago ! And could you <unk> &quot; <unk> like bunnies &quot; from the record ?
Is there , anything in this record that is actually true ?
Well , yes , we got married in Vegas and uh , and the names I think .
Well , based on what I heard , you two certainly don &apos;t <unk> for an annulment . If you two don &apos;t want to be together you &apos;ll have to file for divorce .
That &apos;s great ! Are you happy now ? Look what you did with your funny , funny form !
What ? ! Me ? ! What about you and your <unk> like bunnies nonsense !
And <unk> are you typing that for ? Did you hear what she said ? We don &apos;t get the annulment . Don &apos;t type that ! What ? ! Stop typing ! Hey ! Stop typing ! Stop typing ! Stop typing ! !
Okay , do you see , do you see what you &apos;re keeping me married too ? !
You need to get out of my <unk> .
All right look lady here is the deal , I came here for an annulment and I am not leaving here until I get one !
Yeah !
Would you like to spend the night in jail ?
And thank you for your time .
So the Porsche guy took his car back .
But you found the keys to his clothes ?
No . No , I just uh , I just loved the way it feels when everybody thinks I own a Porsche .
And people will think you own a Porsche because you &apos;re wearing the clothes ?
Of course ! Only an idiot would wear this stuff if you didn &apos;t have the car ! Right ?
That is true .
Yeah , but only a genius would swallow a <unk> <unk> gun .
Oh , I &apos;ve been there . Yeah , I am gonna go drive my Porsche .
Joey , you know you don &apos;t actually have one .
Come on ! What are you doing ? ! I &apos;m in character ! Would you talk to her !
Ahh , I think it just moved . It &apos;s really poking me .
All right , that &apos;s it , we &apos;re going to the emergency room .
What ? ! No , you can &apos;t , you can &apos;t leave me here with them ! We &apos;re <unk> !
The babies are asleep , I &apos;m sure you &apos;ll be okay on your own for a while !
But you-you can &apos;t leave me with them ! We-we &apos;re a team ! We &apos;re playing a zone ! They &apos;re gonna <unk> team me !
He &apos;s got something plastic lodged in his throat , we &apos;ve got to go to the hospital .
But no , because a doctor won &apos;t be able to help him , it &apos;s just gonna y &apos;know <unk> pass through his system in like seven years .
I think that &apos;s gum .
I &apos;m pretty sure it &apos;s gun .
Okay , listen this really hurts . Let &apos;s go .
A real man wouldn &apos;t just run to the hospital ! No ! What would , what would Krog do ?
Why isn &apos;t that <unk> back with my Porsche ?
Maybe because you &apos;ve got the keys ?
Porsche .
This is totally your fault !
My fault ? ! You <unk> the judge !
Well , you ripped the paper out of the court <unk> &apos;s machine ! !
That was the only way I could get him to stop typing !
Hi ! How are the Gellers ?
Don &apos;t call us that !
The judge wouldn &apos;t let us get an annulment ! Now we gotta get a divorce ! ! Did a <unk> throw up on you ?
Hey ! It &apos;s Porsche ! !
Me taking care of you is no problem , huh ? You guys feel safe . Right ? Okay , I &apos;m gonna take that spit bubble as , &quot; Yeah , I do ! &quot; Okay , after I get rid of this dirty diaper Leslie , I &apos;ll set you up with a clean one . Okay , I &apos;m sorry . I didn &apos;t mean to scare you . I just have to clean that up . Okay ? &apos; Cause let &apos;s face it , we &apos;re at Monica &apos;s . I broke it . All right . Well , that &apos;s just the way that goes . Okay , good . Why are there only two of you ? Where is Leslie ? Well , you can &apos;t answer . Leslie ? Where are you Leslie ? Leslie , now would be a good time for your first words ! Well , look at you ! Hey ! You are a little bit mischievous ! My gosh ! Oh , you &apos;re a lot mischievous ! Well , it &apos;ll dry . Okay , you sit with your brother and sister <unk> aren &apos;t there !
Hey !
How do you feel ?
Well , let &apos;s just say that Krog will be fully <unk> to destroy the universe again in twelve to fourteen hours .
Okay , so I totally took care of the babies all by myself ! I <unk> &apos; em , <unk> &apos; em , and put &apos; em to bed .
And <unk> them from a <unk> ?
Oh my God .
I know , the babies are asleep .
Phoebe , what , what happened here ? !
I did it ! I took care of the babies all by myself !
But my apartment !
Was the setting of Phoebe &apos;s triumph .
But the mess !
Is not as important as the fact that Phoebe took care of the babies all by herself .
You &apos;re right , you &apos;re right I shouldn &apos;t freak out . &apos; Cause this is what will happen when you and I have babies ! When will that be ? !
Phoebe , would you take a look at this mess ! ! ! !
Oh honey thank God you &apos;re home , I was getting worried .
I picked up the divorce papers . Uh , I &apos;ve already signed everything and I put little &apos; <unk> &apos;s where you need to sign .
Oh , little &apos; <unk> &apos;s ! Great ! That makes up for everything !
Y &apos;know , <unk> &apos;ve done a lot of stupid stuff too ! Okay ?
Oh , name one stupid thing that is as stupid as this one !
Okay , how about you <unk> to London to stop my wedding ! Ah , how about you told me you loved me after I was already married !
Hey ! Wait a minute ! That was different ! I did those things because I was in love with you !
Yeah ! Right !
You &apos;re right . That &apos;s very different . So let &apos;s , let &apos;s just sign the papers . All right ? What ?
Nothing .
Okay , can we just sign please ?
Uh-hmm .
Congratulations .
Okay Ross , we <unk> a minute . Umm , I uh , I kinda have a little <unk> .
What ?
Well , y &apos;know this whole marriage thing , kinda my idea .
Excuse me ?
Well , remember how we were too drunk to remember anything the night we were married ?
Yeah ?
And uh , yeah , I didn &apos;t really , I didn &apos;t want to say anything , but it kinda it just , it kinda kept coming back to me , and umm , remember we were in the <unk> and for some reason thought it would be funny to eat a lot of grapes . And uh , and I thought it would be <unk> if we got married . So as a , as a compromise we decided first to get married , and then to eat a lot of grapes . So umm , sorry I got us into this mess .
So then <unk> mean if you think about it , this is all your fault .
Yeah , don &apos;t push it though .
I &apos;ve got to say ; I know I divorce a lot of women , never thought I would be <unk> you .
I know . I always thought if you and I got married , it would be the one that stuck . And it wouldn &apos;t be a secret , and we wouldn &apos;t have our wedding dinner at Pizza Hut .
Did I , did I even treat ?
No , it was on the house , it was , it was a <unk> special .
That may be the most depressing thing I &apos;ve heard in my life . I should probably get these to my lawyer &apos;s office .
Hey , thanks Ross , for taking care of all of this .
Eh , no problem .
I &apos;m gonna need a copy of those .
Totally .
Hey ! Hey ! Be careful around my Porsche !
Hi Joey .
Hey ! How you doin &apos; ?
He has the most amazing Porsche under there !
I &apos;d love to show ya , but I just <unk> her in . She &apos;s sleeping . Hey uh , would you two girls like to go for a drink ?
Okay ! Listen , I &apos;m gonna be moving out so you will be in charge of paying the rent .
Right ! And when is that due ?
First of the month .
And that &apos;s every month ?
No , just the months you actually want to live here .
Ahhh .
Okay , here is the phone bill .
Oh my God ! !
That &apos;s our phone number . Now look , I know I kinda <unk> this whole me moving out on thing , so why don &apos;t I <unk> don &apos;t I just cover you for a while ?
No-no ! No way ! Joey Tribbiani does not take charity ... anymore .
It &apos;s not charity , Joe ...
No ! Forget it ! <unk> mean thanks , but I &apos;m done taking money from you . All right , I can take of myself . Now , what &apos;s next ? Come on .
Okay uh , here &apos;s the electric bill .
This is how much we pay for electric ? ! ! !
Uh , yeah .
So , we &apos;ll do the rest of the bills later then ?
So is Joey going to have to give up the apartment ?
No , I hope not ! I tried to offer him some money , but he wouldn &apos;t take it .
Well , how much do you think he needs ?
I figure that $ 1,500 would cover him for a few months , y &apos;know ? But I have to trick him into taking it so I won &apos;t hurt his pride .
Why don &apos;t you hire him as an actor ? You could have him dress up and put on little <unk> . Whatever you want .
Well that would help the pride thing .
Hey !
Hey ! Wow ! You look great ! Wanna move in with me tomorrow ?
Okay .
Okay ! So , what do you girls have planned for tonight ?
Well , instead of being sad that tonight is my last night together with Rachel we thought we &apos;d go out to dinner and celebrate the fact that Rachel is moving in with Phoebe .
And also , my birthday .
It &apos;s not your birthday .
What a mean thing to say ! I would never tell you it &apos;s not your birthday !
Hey !
Hey !
Hey !
Hey ! So you guys have anything planned for the big last night ?
Well , instead of just hanging out , we figure we &apos;d do nothing .
Whoa-whoa-whoa , Knicks season <unk> tonight . I thought maybe you guys would come over and watch it .
I don &apos;t know Ross , not if you &apos;re gonna talk about how you gave up a career in basketball to become a paleontologist .
I did give up a career in basketball to become a paleontologist !
Pheebs , I was wondering ...
You &apos;re not dressed yet ? ! We &apos;re supposed to start having fun in 15 minutes !
Well and clearly not a minute sooner .
Rachel , you are packed though right , I mean please tell me that you &apos;re packed .
Of course I packed ! Monica relax ! I just wanted to ask Phoebe her opinion on what I should wear tonight .
My God , I can &apos;t get a minute of peace around this place .
Oh my God ! Monica &apos;s just gonna kill you .
Yeah , yeah , I know .
Well , what you &apos;re wearing is fine for that .
Rachel , I need to <unk> &apos;re not packed ! ! ! ! You &apos;re not packed even a little bit !
Surprise ! !
What ?
No , no don &apos;t get mad because <unk> is what happened . So I-I started packing , then I realized , &quot; What am I doing ? I am lousy at packing ! &quot; Right ? But you love packing ! So , as a gift to you , on our last night , <unk> !
I &apos;ll be <unk> ! Oh my God ! I &apos;m so sorry , I didn &apos;t get you anything ! Okay , look everybody has to help ! Okay ? You can help , can &apos;t you Phoebe ?
I have plans .
You &apos;re plans were with us .
That &apos;s right .
All right , Chandler can make boxes , Ross can wrap , and Joey can lift things . Now Phoebe , go tell the guys they have to help out !
Okay .
Okay ! Oh my God , thank you ! !
Hurry ! Monica &apos;s gonna make you pack ! She &apos;s got jobs for everyone ! Now , it &apos;s too late for me , but save your <unk> !
Okay ! The <unk> will be here in 11 hours . Rachel has not packed . Now , everybody has to help ! Chandler , we &apos;re gonna start with ...
Oh nope , I-I have plans with Joey .
I thought you said you were going to do nothing .
Yes , but for the last time .
Okay fine , now Ross ...
Oh , but-but I can &apos;t do it .
Why not ?
I &apos;ve got Ben .
Because , because I &apos;ve got Ben .
It &apos;s almost 8 o &apos;clock , it &apos;s almost past his <unk> . Where-where is he ?
He &apos;s at a dinner party .
Is he really coming ? Because I can see right into your apartment !
Of course he is ! What , do you think I &apos;d just use my son as-as an excuse ? What kind of father do you think I am ?
All right , sorry .
I gotta go make a fake Ben .
Here it is ! Our last pizzas together as roommates .
Oh , I wish I &apos;d know you were going to do that , I ordered Chinese .
Oh that &apos;s okay . Hey , actually in a way it &apos;s kinda nice . Me , bringing the food of my <unk> , you , the food of yours !
Say , Joe , I had a strange idea of what we could do for our last night . What do you say we play a little uh , foosball for money ?
What , are you crazy ? You haven &apos;t <unk> me once since my <unk> <unk> &apos; 97 season . It would be easier if you just give me your money .
Yes it would . What do you say to $ 50 ?
Okay , you &apos;re on .
Okay , let &apos;s play ! The big game , <unk> <unk> <unk> , apparently .
<unk> , look it &apos;s the roller blades .
Oh God !
You remember when we got these ?
No .
I guess you weren &apos;t there .
You guys , we said we were gonna have fun ! Come on , hey , remember the time ... You don &apos;t remember ?
I &apos;m sorry Pheebs , I guess I &apos;m just really said that I &apos;m leaving .
I &apos;m gonna miss you so much .
Well , this doesn &apos;t have to be so sad though . Y &apos;know ? Maybe instead of just thinking about how much you &apos;re gonna miss each other , you should like think of the things you &apos;re not gonna miss .
I don &apos;t think there &apos;s anything .
Come on , there &apos;s gotta be something .
Nope , she &apos;s perfect .
I have one .
Good ! Great ! You can go first .
Uh well , I guess I &apos;m not gonna miss the fact that you &apos;re never allowed to move the phone pen .
Good that &apos;s a good one . Okay , Monica , anything ? Y &apos;know ? Does Rachel move the phone pen ?
Aw , sometimes . Always , actually .
Okay , good . There you go . Doesn &apos;t anyone feel better ?
Not just the phone pen . I never get my messages .
You get your messages !
Yeah , well I don &apos;t think it really counts if you have to read them off the back of your hand after you fall asleep on the couch .
So-so , you missed a message from who ? Chandler or your mom ? Or Chandler ? Or your mom ?
Great ! It worked ! No one &apos;s sad .
Yes ! I win again ! Ha-ha ! That &apos;s like 500 bucks you owe me ! <unk> ! $ 500 that is a <unk> of <unk> ! <unk> ! I gotta buy some food .

Hello ? Oh , hi Ross ! See ? Other people call me !
Ooh , your brother . Score !
What &apos;s up ?
Oh , I &apos;m just over here with Ben . I thought we &apos;d say hi .
Oh , put him on !
Ben , say hi to Aunt Monica . Oh , I guess he doesn &apos;t feel like talking right now . He &apos;s smiling though ! Okay , talk to you later .
Yeah , I think it was better when you guys were sad . Hey , uh , remember the roller blades ?
You know what else I &apos;m not gonna miss ? &quot; I &apos;m Monica . I wash the toilet 17 times a day . Even if people are on it ! &quot;

Well , this is the last box of your clothes . I &apos;m just gonna <unk> it , &quot; What were you thinking ? &quot;
Funny , because I was just gonna go across the hall and write that on Chandler .
Hey you guys , I don &apos;t mean to make things worse , but umm , I don &apos;t want to live with Rachel anymore .
What ? !
You &apos;re just so mean to each other ! And I don &apos;t want to end up like that with Rachel . I still like you !

What else ?
When I take a shower , she leaves me little <unk> on the mirror .
Yeah , I do . I-I do , do that .
That &apos;s nice . I like having things to read in the bathroom .
When I fall asleep on the couch after reading , she covers me over with a blanket .
Well y &apos;know , I don &apos;t want you to be cold .
And when I told her that I was gonna be moving in with Chandler , she was really supportive . You were so great . You made it so easy . And now you have to leave . And I have to live with a boy ! !
Oh , it &apos;s gonna be fine .
Okay Rachel , I can &apos;t wait to live with you ! And you know what we should do ? Bring Monica and then we could all live there together ! We &apos;ll have so much fun ! !

All right , let &apos;s play one more hand ! One more !
No , no , no more ! I cannot lose another <unk> ! I &apos;m serious this time ! In-in fact , look , there &apos;s <unk> wanna give you something . And let me give it too you know before I <unk> it for Cups money . Now , I want you to have the big white dog as a kinda of a , y &apos;know , thank you for being such a great roommate .
I can &apos;t take the big white dog ! You love it !
It &apos;s him , not it !
No , but <unk> if I bought it from you , y &apos;know ? And your nice gesture would be giving it to me at a <unk> price , say $ 1,500 ?
Wait a second , I see what you &apos;re trying to do here ! You-you &apos;re trying to give me money again !
When did I try to give you money ?
Over there ! Before , with the bills ! You tried to give some charity , I said &quot; No , &quot; you dropped it . Okay ? Then we had a nice last night together , we had some fun , we <unk> , nobody tried to give anybody any money ! Now out of the blue , you start with the charity thing again !
I &apos;m just trying to help you out ! Okay ? I wanna make sure that you &apos;re okay .
I will be okay ! Look Chandler , you gotta get it out of your head that I can &apos;t take care of myself . Okay ? Look , I &apos;m not gonna miss you helping me out with money . The only thing that I &apos;m gonna miss ... is you . And now the dog .

Can I ask you a question ?
Sure !
What the hell is that dog doing here ? !
I invented the game of Cups as a way to give Joey money .
And now you want that money back .
Exactly .
Chandler , what kind of an idiot do you take me for ?
It &apos;s not a real game ! I made it up !
I &apos;m sorry you lost your money , but I won it fair and <unk> .
At a fake game ! !
Now , if you wanna try to make some of it back , I &apos;d be glad to play you for it . But I should <unk> you , I am very good at Cups .
Okay ! Now I assume the <unk> card came up when you played last .

Whoa , hello , did you just meet Monica ?
She is gonna recognize that I did a nice thing and-and , appreciate it .
Hmm <unk> know , actually this &apos;ll work out well . Cause when you have to move back in with Joey , Joey &apos;s hot new roommate can come and live with me .
I see , I see , <unk> &apos;re trying to freak me out .
Look Chandler , Monica is really weird about this kind stuff all right . Believe me , I lived with her for <unk> years . She is going to freak ... out . Oh my God , she &apos;s going to sit on you .
No , she &apos;s not okay ? And I &apos;ll prove it to you . I &apos;m gonna call her right now . Phone &apos;s done <unk> .
Hi !
Hey Mon , how &apos;s it going ?
Terrible . If-if I want something done right , I have to do it myself . Other people just wreck stuff . I really think I might kill someone tonight .
Oh come on , come on , it can &apos;t be that bad .
It &apos;s worse . The only thing that &apos;s getting me through is knowing that I &apos;m gonna be seeing you soon . I think I may even try to get out of here early .
No ! <unk> . It sounds like they really need you down there .
Well , are you just hanging out with Ross ?
It &apos;s , all good ! Okay bye-bye Mon ! She &apos;s-she &apos;s gonna kill me .
Yeah , the phone was <unk> the other way . And that goes back up there .
We should start with the big stuff . Y &apos;know ? That &apos;ll be the <unk> . Uh , let &apos;s start with the couch . I got it .
Yeah that-that , doesn &apos;t look right .
What are you talking about ? The couch is perfectly in line with the carpet . And then I can just walk over here and <unk> just put my feet right up on the ... OK , OK , here &apos;s what we do , we just uh , move the couch closer to the coffee table .
Whoa , whoa , but then the back of the couch won &apos;t line up with he back of the carpet .
OK well here , we &apos;ll just move the coffee table closer to the couch .
Whoa , Whoa , Whoa , but then the coffee table won &apos;t be <unk> in the <unk> area .
Yes , but the coffee table doesn &apos;t match the ... <unk> ; <unk> ... <unk> ! ! ! !
Look , what am I gonna do ? I &apos;m not flirting but still , I &apos;m drawing her to me like <unk> like a <unk> to a flame ! What the hell &apos;s going on over here ? ! ? ! ? Monica &apos;s gonna kill you ! Look I need your help , I have to do something to-to repel this woman ! Wait a minute , wait a minute , you guys repel women all the time .
Hey , I &apos;ve been married 3 times
No-no-no I &apos;ve seen it happen , you-you get a <unk> going with a woman but somehow you manage to kill it . What &apos;s your secret ?
Look , we do not repel women OK ? That is completely <unk> .
Oh no , yes we do my man . Remember when we were back in college and we went to that spring dance and you walked right up to that girl you liked and you could not stop talking about the Irish potato <unk> ?
Yeah , well what about you ? You weren &apos;t you know , so hot in college either . After everything he said , he &apos;d go &quot; <unk> dum bum <unk> &quot;
Yeah , Monica doesn &apos;t like that either , Maybe I should stop doing that .
Oh y &apos;know what , girls don &apos;t like it when I start talking about science .
That &apos;s not <unk> to girls .
This is great , this is great , what else , what else ?
Uh , they don &apos;t like it when you correct their <unk> .
And they don &apos;t like it when you explain why your jokes are funny .
They don &apos;t like it when you keep asking them if they like you .
Man , I &apos;m so lucky I have Monica .
I &apos;m never gonna find love again .
Hey Phoebe , can I talk to you for a second ?
Sure
Okay , um , I ... All right Phoebe look , I just wanted to say that I &apos;m sorry . OK ? I <unk> the situation <unk> and I should not have lied to you .
So , what should you have done ?
Well , I-I should &apos;ve told you the truth .
<unk> , Which is ... ?
Well , y &apos;know , the reason I didn &apos;t wanna go running with you is because um , well y &apos;know the way that you run is a little ...
So ?
Well , it &apos;s embarrassing . People were looking at us like we were crazy .
Why do you care ?
Because they &apos;re people .
But people that you don &apos;t know and will never see again .
Yes , but still . They &apos;re people ... with eyes .
Well , I didn &apos;t get embarrassed running next to Miss . But no , okay . No , no , I can see why running with me would be embarrassing to you . Yeah , okay . You &apos;re <unk> .
I-I am not <unk> ! Listen , I am not <unk> , man .
That &apos;s okay Rachel . I &apos;m not judging you ; that &apos;s just who you are . Me . I &apos;m more free y &apos;know ? I run like I did when I was a kid , cause that &apos;s the only way it &apos;s fun . Y &apos;know , I mean didn &apos;t you ever run so fast you thought your legs were gonna fall off ? Y &apos;know , like when you were like running <unk> the swings or running away from Satan ? The neighbor &apos;s dog .
Okay , is this lamp in the same place ?
Who cares ? I repel women .
<unk> ! ! ! You can &apos;t come in here ! <unk> is naked .
What ? !
What ? !
I couldn &apos;t say that I was naked because she &apos;s allowed too see me naked .
Why does anyone have to be naked ?
Why is Ross naked ?
I-I had to show Chandler something ?
Naked ?
Yeah-yeah I uh , I have a uh , a guy problem .
Is it the same thing that Chandler had ?
Look , uh , just come later , we &apos;ll get everything <unk> away and you can come back later .
Okay , listen , there &apos;s still some of Chandler &apos;s medicine under the sink in the bathroom . Bye !
Bye ! Thank God
Dude , what &apos;d you have ?
Look , we have no time okay ? We must focus . We gotta get everything back into its original place .
The photo album ! There were millions of pictures of the apartment in the photo album . We just go through it and match everything to the pictures .
That &apos;s perfect ! That &apos;s brilliant !
So really , what &apos;d ya have ?
Hey Joey , I got some beer for you .
Uh , don &apos;t you mean &quot; for whom ? &quot;
Sure , listen I was gonna order some pizza , you wanna share one ?
Pizza , <unk> , its not like I never had that before ... <unk> dum bum <unk> .
Is there something wrong ?
All right , All right , let &apos;s just get this out in the open okay ? You &apos;re hot . I &apos;m <unk> . Clearly there &apos;s a vibe going on between us . But , we &apos;re roommates and it &apos;s a huge mistake for us to continue down this road .
Joey ...
No , no , no , I &apos;m telling ya . <unk> yourself living in a supermarket and you will understand okay ? So the question is , what do we do ?
Well , I don &apos;t think there is anything to do . I mean I think you &apos;re really sweet , but I &apos;m just not interested in you like that .
Oh !
No ! I mean you &apos;re a really nice guy and I &apos;m happy to be your roommate and your friend , I &apos;m just y &apos;know , I just don &apos;t feel that way about you .
Oh ! I see what happened . It &apos;s because I was trying to repel you . Right ? Believe me , you &apos;d feel a lot different if I turned it on .
I don &apos;t think so .
Oh , I do . How you doin ?
I &apos;m OK
What ? ! ? !
What ?
Oh dear God !
Hey !
Hey !
Oh honey , I &apos;m so sorry , you were right , this feels great !
See ? And you don &apos;t care if people are staring , it &apos;s just for a second cause then you &apos;re gone !
<unk> ! I mean its amazing Pheebs . I feel so free and so <unk> . Hey ! Look out for the horse ! Sorry !
Is it okay for me to come in now ?
Uh-huh
Why is everything different ?
Bye !
No , I don &apos;t see anything different other than the fact that the room got so much <unk> when you came into it .
Well , the end table is wrong , The couch looks <unk> and don &apos;t even get me started on the refrigerator <unk> .
Okay look , don &apos;t ... don &apos;t be mad okay ? But after I <unk> the boxes I wanted to do something nice for you , so , I-I-I cleaned the apartment . So I moved everything around and then I forgot where it , where it went back and I &apos;m sorry , I &apos;m very sorry , I &apos;m sorry , I &apos;m sorry .
It &apos;s okay . Chandler , are you afraid of me or something ?
Do you want me to be afraid of you ?
Of course not . I mean gosh , Chandler what you did , it &apos;s , it &apos;s a wonderful thing and I really appreciate it . I know I have this weird thing where I want everything to be in the perfect place , but I &apos;d never expect you to worry about that .
Really ?
Of course !
Oh well you &apos;re the best . You come here to me .
All right , hold on okay ? First thing &apos;s first . Okay , now did Ross sit anywhere while he was naked ?
So it said that by the year <unk> , there &apos;ll be <unk> that can carry out the same number of <unk> as an actual human brain . So theoretically we could <unk> our thoughts and our memories into this computer ...

That &apos;s so Janine , you-you-you know what , do you know we &apos;re doing right now ? You and I , we &apos;re <unk> .

That &apos;s weird . I don &apos;t think my boss likes me either .
I don &apos;t think mine likes me either .
Maybe it &apos;s a <unk> thing ?
Or maybe , it &apos;s because you &apos;re hanging around here at 11 : 30 on a Wednesday .
Yeah let &apos;s head off to work .
We should go .
Thank you .
Sure .
Now you will not believe this . But , I was in the copy room , making copies , and Ralph Lauren came in .
Oh my God . Did you talk to him ?
Yeah a little . He seems really nice . Good kisser .
What ? What ! ? ! You kissed him ?
Totally .
Phoebe are you serious ?
Yeah . I was just in there . He <unk> himself and the next thing I know , we &apos;re making out . You know .
Phoebe , I mean , you do know he &apos;s married ?
No !
Phoebe ...
What am I supposed to do ? Ask every guy I make out with if he &apos;s married ? No , yeah , I should .
Hey Joey .
Hey . Uh , can I talk to you for a second ? This , uh , kid in this picture . Do you , uh , know this kid ? Is that like a <unk> or something ?
No , I just thought it was cute .
Yeah , that &apos;s what I was afraid of .. Okay , uhh ... Look Janine I really want you to feel at home here , but some of this new stuff . It &apos;s ... too <unk> .
Ohh . Like what ?
Like this . Pictures of cute babies we don &apos;t know . We .. we can &apos;t have that .
Joey , it &apos;s <unk> <unk> . She &apos;s a famous artist .
Look I don &apos;t know this baby . I don &apos;t know if she &apos;s a famous artist or not . You know , and I don &apos;t want to be a jerk but you &apos;re changing too much around here .
Well , I &apos;m sorry . I just thought I &apos;d try to make the place a little nicer .
Yeah but it &apos;s too much stuff . You know like , you got the candles and the <unk> <unk> thing here and over here you got a picture of a watering can .
Well I just thought ...
I &apos;m sure it &apos;s a famous watering can , okay . But , come on ... and what is with the really hot stick in the bathroom ?
It &apos;s a curling iron .
Ohh , well , that &apos;s ok then . But , okay my towels for instance . I come in to the bathroom here and my towel is not on the floor where keep it . It &apos;s up here on some hook .. and ... smells different .
It &apos;s clean .
Yeah , well , it feels different .
It &apos;s dry .
Alright , I can make my peace with the clean dry towels ... Also what is with these chips you bought ?
No no no no , it &apos;s potpourri . You &apos;re supposed to smell it .
Well that &apos;s like summer in a bowl .
Oh , Kim , Hi .
<unk> .
So you know , I ... I handed in that marketing report and I never got to hear what you thought .
I didn &apos;t read it .
Ahh .... So ... Wow ... The spring line , it &apos;s really going to be great this year , huh ?

She will be after tonight .
Yeah .
Oh , hey , hey Rach , do you notice anything .. ahh ...

What ? ? ?
Oh my <unk> .
Yeah I know . She ran into him at my office and they just ... made out . And the <unk> thing is , now my boss likes me because I told her about it and she said it was the best gossip she &apos;d heard all year .
I am proud of all my friends today .
My God , Rachel , I can &apos;t believe Phoebe made out with Ralph Lauren . Ohh , I &apos;m so jealous .
Hi , I &apos;m Chandler . Your <unk> boy
Chandler , please , come on . Look at him .
Oh , I am no women , but that is one <unk> dish .
Hey . Here . Ohh , who &apos;s the <unk> fox ?
That-that is your make out buddy . Don &apos;t you recognize him ? Oh wait . Ohh , Phoebe I love you . Kiss me please .
That &apos;s not Ralph Lauren . Sounds like him though .
What ?
Yeah , no , Ralph doesn &apos;t look anything like that guy . He &apos;s-he &apos;s young and he &apos;s got long hair and a beard and a <unk> <unk> .
Oh My God , Phoebe , that &apos;s not Ralph Lauren . That &apos;s Kenny the copy guy .
What ?
Oh .. Go .. Oh .. and I told my boss that someone made out with Ralph Lauren . If she finds out that I lied to her , she is going to hate me even more . Phoebe ! !
Why would the copy guy say he was Ralph Lauren ?
To get you to make out with him ! ! !
Ohhh .
Okay , maybe this will make your teeth look less white . Nope . Okay , colors that don &apos;t work are blue , yellow , green , red , black , white , orange , and purple .
I don &apos;t know what I &apos;m going to do . That date starts in like an hour .
Hey Ross , maybe if your skin was lighter . Your teeth wouldn &apos;t look so <unk> .
Oh great . So all I need to do is get some new skin . Thank you .
I &apos;m just saying , if we put just a little bit of makeup on you .
Whoa . Whoa . Whoa . We &apos;re not 13 anymore .
Ross this is the only thing left that has a shot at working .
But , won &apos;t she notice I have makeup on ?
Please . Half the guys out there have makeup on .
What ? ?
All right , half the people . I mean , just try it and see .
No . I am not putting on makeup .
Hello . Oh good . Ross could you put up some of these flyers for me ? OH ! ! <unk> ! ! <unk> ! !
Now are <unk> will smell nice and we didn &apos;t waste these <unk> .
Yes , God <unk> we throw out old underwear . You-you know what ? I &apos;m going to go over to Joey &apos;s .
Wait , we &apos;re supposed to <unk> the wrapping paper drawer .
Yes , but I feel like I &apos;ve really gotten in touch with my <unk> side enough today . You know . In fact I think we &apos;re two <unk> away from becoming a lesbian couple .
You know what ? This has been kind of a girlie day . You &apos;re right , I &apos;m sorry .
Nah , Nah , it &apos;s okay . I feel like I need to be in guy place . You know , do kind of like a man thing .
Yeah . Go over to Joey &apos;s . Go over to Joey &apos;s and drink some beer and hammer up some <unk> .
You know when guys hang out they don &apos;t just drink some beer and hammer up <unk> ?
When girls hang out , we don &apos;t have pillow fights in our underwear . I &apos;m sorry . We do . We do . I don &apos;t know why I said that .
Hey Chandler . Come on in . We &apos;re <unk> pot <unk> .
No thanks , Josephine .
Hey Ross , I was wondering if ... Oh my God ! ! Where are all the men ? ? ?
Ohh , hi , Kim .
Hi Rachel .
Yeah , remember that thing I told you that happened yesterday ? Well it didn &apos;t happen .
You didn &apos;t cancel the <unk> order from <unk> ?
Okay , two things didn &apos;t happen . Remember I told you that someone made out with Ralph Lauren in the copy room ? Well , it turns out that &apos;s not true .
That &apos;s not true ?
No .
Oh that &apos;s interesting ? Because I checked and only one keycard was used to access the copy machine yesterday during lunch and that keycard <unk> to you , Rachel .
Oh no , no , no . Oh God , you think I made out with him .
Listen to me . If you think sleeping with Ralph is going to get you my job . You are <unk> <unk> .
I-I don &apos;t want your job . I-I don &apos;t . Ohh this is such a mistake . I did not make out with him . Nobody made out with him . I did not use my keycard yesterday . I don &apos;t even know how to use my keycard .
Hi Ralph .
Hi Kim .
Yeah , nothing happen . You could cut the sexual <unk> in here with a knife .
And after that , what could I do except become a chef .
<unk> .
And someday soon , I hope to open my own restaurant .
Mmm .
You know , you &apos;re a really great <unk> . Most guys I go out with , they just talk and talk .
<unk> .
After a while it &apos;s like , shut your mouth , you know ?
<unk> .
I &apos;ve probably been talking too much . Why don &apos;t we talk about you a little bit ?
<unk> .
Come on . I want to know .
<unk> . Okay . I , uh , am from Long Island . I-I came to the city for college . Um , I , um , have a 5 year old son and in my spare time I like to read <unk> <unk> . But , but , let &apos;s talk more about you . Hmm .
So what &apos;s really neat . If you <unk> the <unk> of the flowers first in a <unk> pan , your <unk> will look fresh much longer .
Oh my God , Joey , that is such a great tip .
Monica , could you excuse us for a second ? I need to talk to the girl with the flowers .
Okay . Oh but Joey , come over later because I &apos;m going to teach you to make a bird <unk> out of just a <unk> <unk> and some peanut butter .
Ohh , I love birds .
What is the matter with you ? ! ?
What ?
You &apos;re <unk> flowers ! You got dead flowers ! You got a picture , a picture , of a baby dressed like flowers ! This is not Joey ! !
Hey . Hey look I am still Joey , okay . Flowers they &apos;re just , you know , they &apos;re nice to look at . And that happens to be a picture by a famous artist . Of a famous baby .
You &apos;re turning into a women .
No I &apos;m not . Why would you say that ? That &apos;s just mean .
Now I &apos;ve upset you ? What did I say ?
It &apos;s not what you said . It &apos;s the way you said it .... Oh My God , I &apos;m a woman ! ! !
Now , she thinks that I made out with him and I did it to get her job .
But why didn &apos;t you just tell her the truth .
I did but she doesn &apos;t think anyone would be stupid enough to <unk> Kenny the copy guy with Ralph Lauren .
Well , hey , what if Kenny were the real brains behind the whole company ? You know . What if Kenny hired that Ralph Lauren guy to be the pretty front man ? Huh , did she ever think of that ?
You were with Kenny today , weren &apos;t you ?
Just for a second .
Ohh , Phoebe , what am I going to do ?
Well , the only thing you can do . <unk> with Ralph Lauren .
I &apos;m not going to sleep with Ralph Lauren . I mean , I could , but I wouldn &apos;t .
Ohh , sleep with Kenny .
That wouldn &apos;t help me .
Ohh , yes it would .
I &apos;ve had a really good time tonight .
Mmm .
You know , I <unk> connect with someone this much on the first date .
<unk> . Me , neither . I &apos;ve had a really good time too , you know .
Are you going to eat that bread ?
Ohh , I just like the smell . <unk> .
You make me laugh .
<unk> .
Would you like to move over to the couch ?
<unk> .
Maybe I &apos;ll just turn the lights down a little .
How about all the way .
Okay .
Wow , cool poster . Or should I say <unk> poster ? So , ahh , where were we ?
Are those your teeth ? ?
Ohh , you can see them , huh ?
Yes . They &apos;re <unk> white .
I-I , did that for you .
What &apos;s a matter with you ?
What &apos;s a matter with me ? You &apos;ve got a black light . It &apos;s <unk> !
Kim , hi .
Hi Rachel . Ohh , I &apos;ve been meaning to ask you . Have you seen the new Ralph Lauren sheets ? Ohh , what am I thinking . Of course you have .
Okay .. Okay .. Look . I &apos;m sorry that I lied to you before . You were right . Ralph and I were an item but were not anymore .
Oh , really ?
Yeah , he dumped me . He said , &quot; Rachel , I can &apos;t do this . Even though you are a very , very , very beautiful woman . I can &apos;t do this . I &apos;m married and I &apos;m sorry . &quot; And then I don &apos;t know why but he said , &quot; and you will never get <unk> . Especially not <unk> Kim , who is an <unk> <unk> in the Ralph Lauren machine . &quot;
You expect me to believe .. Hi Ralph .
Hi Kim .
Oh my God . He just gave you the <unk> look I have ever seen . It &apos;s like he hates you . Then it is true .
Of course it &apos;s true and it hurts so bad .
Ohh honey come here . Ohh it will be ok . We &apos;ve all been there .
You and Ralph ?
Kenny the <unk> .
Hey .
Hey , uhh , I need to talk to you .
What &apos;s the matter ? Are you upset ?
I &apos;m sorry but we &apos;ve got to get rid of all this girlie stuff in here . I , uh , I got to be a man ! Okay . The living room has to <unk> a guy place , okay ? That &apos;s just the way it has to be .
Well , if that &apos;s what you want . I &apos;ll just put it all in my room .
Great ... Great ... and thanks for being so understanding . I mean , I didn &apos;t want to make a big deal out of this , you know . You could , uh , put the picture of the famous baby in my room . I mean , if you want to .
Okay .
And , uhh , maybe the watering can there .
Sure .
And a couple of these little tiny boxes .
Joey ? Do you want me to put it all in your room ?
Okay .
Okay , great ! Bye . So guess who &apos;s coming to Thanksgiving dinner ?
<unk> <unk> ? <unk> .
I miss Rachel . No , my parents .
Oh ! That &apos;s great , they haven &apos;t seen the place since I moved in !
Yeah , and y &apos;know , if you could not mention to them that we live together , that would be great ! , I was thinking we would eat around four .
Why can &apos;t I tell them that we live together ?
Because they don &apos;t know we &apos;re dating . Do you think we should eat in the kitchen ?
Why haven &apos;t you told them ? !
Um , well , I was going to , I-I-I really was . But um , then somewhere , just out of nowhere , I didn &apos;t .
Why haven &apos;t you told them ? ! Wouldn &apos;t they be happy ? !
So ! <unk> in the kitchen around four ! I &apos;ll see you then .
Why wouldn &apos;t they be happy ?
Well , um , because <unk> , um , they don &apos;t like you . I &apos;m sorry .
What ? What ? Why ? !
Maybe because you used to be aloof , or that you &apos;re really sarcastic , or that , y &apos;know , you joke around all the time . Or that you take off your clothes and throw them on the couch .
Is this why they don &apos;t like me or why you don &apos;t like me ?
Look , I know that I should &apos;ve told them . I know I shouldn &apos;t care what they think . I &apos;m sorry .
Y &apos;know , it &apos;ll be okay . It &apos;ll be okay . Because when they come over , I will be all charming , I will make them fall in love with me , and then we &apos;ll tell &apos; em .
You really think that &apos;ll work ?
Hey , I can be pretty charming , babe , I won YOU over , didn &apos;t I ?
I don &apos;t think you &apos;ll ever get my parents that drunk !
Hey ! Oh , good , Ross ! You &apos;re parents like me , right ?
Yes , of course they like you !
Well Monica just told me that they don &apos;t .
Yeah , they don &apos;t like you .
Do you know why ?
I dunno , maybe it &apos;s because you &apos;re really sarcastic . Or maybe it &apos;s cause you <unk>
Well if people don &apos;t know they shouldn &apos;t just guess !
This is great , another Thanksgiving with nothing to give thanks for .
Maybe I could give thanks for you <unk> &apos; up , eh ?
Maybe I could give thanks by taking my <unk> over to my new apartment .
Well maybe I love ya &apos; .

Oh , but-but it is , uh , it &apos;s just like the first Thanksgiving , when the Indians and the <unk> uh , sat down to dinner .
Yeah , yeah , and the Indians taught the <unk> what it meant to be hot in the new world !
Hello everybody !

Ok , I have <unk> . There &apos;s no need to laugh and point .
Dad , Chandler was just laughing at your joke .
My joke wasn &apos;t funny .
Rach , Rach , I just remembered . I had a dream about Mr. Geller last night .
Really ? !
Yeah , I dreamt that he saved me from a burning building and he was so brave and so strong ! And it &apos;s making me look at him totally differently . Y &apos;know , I mean he used to be just , y &apos;know &quot; Jack Geller Monica and Ross &apos;s dad &quot; and now he &apos;s he &apos;s &quot; Jack Geller , dream <unk> . &quot;
I dunno . Y &apos;know to me he &apos;ll always be &quot; Jack Geller , walks in while you &apos;re changing . &quot;
Y &apos;know dad , Chandler is one of Ross &apos;s very best friends !
Yeah , Ross sure is a great guy , y &apos;know I &apos;ve always felt that how a young man turns out is a <unk> on his father .
I always thought that too . Tell me , what does your father do ?
He &apos;s the <unk> of a gay <unk> show .
Rach , you &apos;re <unk> &apos; us here , will ya serve the dessert already ? Those drunken dancers are waiting !
Look at it , isn &apos;t it beautiful ?
Yeah , yeah , what is it ?
It &apos;s a <unk> . It &apos;s got all of these layers . First there &apos;s a layer of ladyfingers , then a layer of jam , then custard , which I made from <unk> , then <unk> , more ladyfingers , then beef <unk> with <unk> and <unk> , then a little more custard , and then bananas , and then I just put some whipped cream on top !
<unk> was the one right before bananas ?
The beef ? Yeah , that was weird to me , too . But then , y &apos;know , I thought &quot; well , there &apos;s <unk> pie , &quot; I mean that &apos;s an English dessert , these people just put very strange things in their food , y &apos;know . Oh ! by the way , can I borrow some <unk> from your place ?

And while I &apos;m gone don &apos;t you boys sneak a taste .
Okay .
<unk> in a dessert ? ! I- no no no , there is no way !
I know , and only one layer of jam ? ! What is up with that ?
Oh my God , the pages are stuck together !
Chandler !
Oh My God , she-she made half a English <unk> , and half a ... <unk> &apos;s Pie !
Oh man ! Now she &apos;s gonna start all over ! We &apos;re never gonna get to introduce the hot girls to the new world !
No , no , we will . We just won &apos;t tell her she messed up .
Just let her serve the <unk> thing ?
Yeah , it &apos;ll be like a funny Thanksgiving story !
<unk> stories are funny ...
Joey , God , your apartment is like a hundred <unk> !
Did-did it make you wanna walk around in your underwear ?
No !
Still not hot enough !
Rachel ?
Yeah ?
Okay , look at him . Look at those strong hands . Oh what I wouldn &apos;t give to be that can of <unk> milk .

Oh , thank you Chandler ! I just bought it .
Oh , yes . Well it &apos;s very beautiful . It &apos;s <unk> and tight I don &apos;t mean tight , I mean it &apos;s not too tight , not that I was looking <unk>
What &apos;s the matter with him ?
I think he &apos;s stoned again .
What ?
What ?
Dude , I need to talk to you a sec .
Okay , I think I might know why my parents don &apos;t like you .
You do ? Why ?
Okay , remember , we were young . Hey , Spring break , <unk> year , I got high in my bedroom and my parents walked in and smelled it and so I told them that you had gotten stoned and jumped out the window .
What ? ! Why did you do that ?
I don &apos;t know , <unk> , your &apos;s was the first name that-that <unk> into my head , I &apos;m I &apos;m sorry . I-I didn &apos;t think it would matter .
How could it not matter ? !
How was I supposed to know we &apos;d end up being friends after college , let alone you-you would be living with my sister ?
What about all that &quot; friends forever &quot; stuff ?
I don &apos;t know , I-I was all high .
Mom and dad just sent me in here to find out if you were trying to get Ross stoned !
Your parents caught Ross smoking pot in college and he <unk> it on me !
Ross , I can &apos;t believe you &apos;d do that !
The reason we haven &apos;t told them we &apos;re together is because they hate me , okay ? So will you fix this ?
Okay , okay , I &apos;ll tell &apos; em it wasn &apos;t Chandler who got high . Now who should I say it was ?
You ! It &apos;s not like it &apos;s a big deal ! You-you don &apos;t still do it or anything !
Alright , alright , now-now who should I say <unk> me into doing it ?
Dad , please don &apos;t pick your teeth out here ! Alright , and if you &apos;re gonna put your feet up , why don &apos;t you sit on <unk>
Monica , leave him alone !
Will you hurry up ? Did you not hear me before when I told you that all of Janine &apos;s friends are dancers ? ! And that they &apos;re going to be drinking <unk> ! ?
No , I did , but tell me again , because it &apos;s so romantic .
Well you &apos;re <unk> &apos; so slow ! Can &apos;t you do it any faster ?
Joey ! Come on ! I don &apos;t wanna make any <unk> , alright ? This is the only dessert and if I screw it up everybody &apos;s gonna be like &quot; Oh , remember that Thanksgiving when Rachel screwed up the trifle ? &quot;
So why don &apos;t you just let me worry about making the trifle and you just worry about eating it , alright ?
Oh I am !
Ross , if you don &apos;t tell them , then I will !
Okay , fine !
Ross ! Can I talk to you for a second ?
Oh , uh , can it wait a second Joey ? I have to tell my parents something . No it can &apos;t ? Okay .
Okay , look , I think we have to tell Rachel she messed up her dessert .
What ? ! What is with everybody ? It &apos;s Thanksgiving , not ... <unk> !
Look , when everyone eats that ... that ... <unk> thing , they &apos;re all gonna &apos; make fun of her , do you want that ?
Okay , okay , we &apos;ll just get everyone to act like they like it . That-that way <unk> makes fun of her and we still get to go to Sweet <unk> Pie !
Dude , they &apos;re not <unk> .
Just kiddin , &apos; I &apos;ll talk to them , you distract Rach .

So um ... Thanksgiving . The holiday season is upon us , <unk> ?
Yeah !
And um ... You look nice today .
Oh no . No Ross , don &apos;t do this .
What ?
I <unk> I don &apos;t think us getting back together is a good idea .
Eh ?
I thought this might happen today . Ross , I know the holidays can be rough . Y &apos;know ? And it &apos;s probably really hard for you to be alone right now .
You &apos;re alone .
No , I-I live with Phoebe . I mean you &apos;re alone , alone . And I just-it &apos;s just not the time for us . I &apos;m sorry .
Ah well , can &apos;t blame a guy for trying !
Oh and Okay , and uh if anyone needs help pretending to like it , I learned something in acting class , try uh , rubbing your stomach or uh , or saying &quot; <unk> &quot; and uh , oh oh ! And smiling , okay ?
Yeah , I &apos;m not gonna pay for those acting classes anymore .
Rachel , there you are ! Come on , let &apos;s serve that dessert already !
Joey , you &apos;re gonna have to stop rushing me , you know what ? You don &apos;t get any dessert .
Really ?
No , I &apos;m just kidding I would never do that to you ! Okay , everybody , it &apos;s trifle time !
So , now , Rach , this is a traditional English trifle , isn &apos;t it ?
It sure is .
Wow . So then did you make it with beef or <unk> ?
<unk> .
I can &apos;t have any . You know I don &apos;t eat meat . Ohhh no .
Alright , Monica , I want you to have the first taste .
Really ?
Oh oh oh , wait ! You only got whipped cream in there ! Ya gotta take a bite with all the layers !
Okay .
Op ! Wait , you dropped a <unk> .
Well ?
<unk> ! It &apos;s good !
Really ? How good ?
It &apos;s so good , that I feel really selfish about being the only one who &apos;s eating it , that I think we should have everyone taste how good it is . Especially Ross .
Mmm .
Yeah , this is so good , that I &apos;m gonna go enjoy it on the balcony so that I can enjoy the view <unk> I enjoy my dessert .
I &apos;ve gotta call my friend Mary and tell her how good this is , from Monica &apos;s room .
I &apos;ll help you dial .
I &apos;m gonna go into the bathroom so I can look at it in the mirror , as I eat it .
Okay , now what was that all about ? Is <unk> it not taste good ? Let me try it .
Wha ? No no ! Ah ! All gone ! So good ! Maybe Chandler has some left .
It tastes like feet !
I like it .
Are you kidding ?
What &apos;s not to like ? <unk> ? Good . Jam ? Good . <unk> ? <unk> .
... So a bird just grabbed it , and then tried to fly away with it and , and then just dropped it on the street ?
Yes , but if it &apos;s any consolation , before the bird dropped it , he seemed to enjoy it .
Rachel , come here . Okay , I was just starting to take my Thanksgiving nap , and I had another dream about Jack .
Oh , Phoebe , do I wanna hear this ?
I dunno , let &apos;s see ! So , okay , I dreamt that we were gonna get married , and he left , <unk> he had to go fight a fire . And , um , so okay , I went to a night club , and I saw him making out with a girl .
Oh my God , he <unk> on you !
Yeah , but then Jacques Cousteau came and he kicked his ass for betraying me ! It was soo cool ! Then , he took me <unk> and he <unk> me to his pet <unk> , who , by the way , was totally coming on to me , and please , that is not gonna happen .
Boy , I &apos;m glad I wore the big <unk> today .
Five minutes ago , a line like that would &apos;ve <unk> me . Now nothing . Well , not nothing , I am still a woman .
Ross ? Let &apos;s go .
Oh yeah , about telling Mom and Dad , I was thinking about maybe writing a letter .
Alright , you know what ? That &apos;s it . You &apos;ve had your chance .

Mom ! Dad ! Ross smoked pot in college !
What ? !
You are such a <unk> ! Mom , Dad , you remember that-that time you walked in my room and smelled <unk> ?
Yes .
Well I told you it was Chandler who was smoking the pot but it was me . I &apos;m sorry .
It was you ?
And Dad , y &apos;know that mailman that you got fired ? He didn &apos;t steal your <unk> ! Ross did !
Yeah , well , <unk> Gloria didn &apos;t break the porch swing , Monica did !
Ross hasn &apos;t worked at the museum for a year !
Monica and Chandler are living together !
Ross married Rachel in Vegas ! And got divorced ! Again ! ! ! !
I love Jacques Cousteau !
I wasn &apos;t supposed to put beef in the trifle !
I wanna <unk> !
That &apos;s <unk> of information to get in in thirty seconds ! Alright Joey , if wanna leave , just leave . Rachel , no you weren &apos;t supposed to put beef in the trifle . It did not taste good . Phoebe , I &apos;m sorry , but I think Jacques Cousteau is dead . Monica , why you felt you had to hide the fact that you were in an important relationship is beyond me .
And we kinda figured about the porch swing .
Ross , drugs ? <unk> ? Again ?
What happened son ?
I-I uh , I got <unk> into all those things !
Chandler ! You &apos;ve been Ross &apos;s best friend all these years , stuck by him during the drug problems . And now you &apos;ve taken on Monica as well . Well , I don &apos;t know what to say . You &apos;re a wonderful human being .
Thank you !
No ! Thank you ! Monica , and Ross ! I don &apos;t know what I &apos;m gonna do about the two of you !
I &apos;ll talk to them !
You guys ! It was bananas , cream , and beef ! I-I just cannot believe that you ate that so that I wouldn &apos;t feel bad !
Well actually , I-I didn &apos;t eat mine . It &apos;s still in the bathroom .
No it isn &apos;t , I ate that .
Well we left ours in Monica &apos;s bedroom .
Nope , got it and I got yours too .
Let me ask you , why is everybody using these tiny lights <unk> ? I remember when people used to use big lights .
That &apos;s a good story , <unk> .
Hey
Hey
Wow , Monica &apos;s letting other people help decorate her tree ! Did someone get her drunk again or ?
Having a perfectly <unk> tree is not what Christmas is about . It &apos;s about being with the people that you love .
That is nice and we &apos;re done . <unk> !
I dunno what it is , it just doesn &apos;t quite feel like Christmas to me .
Oh , here .
See now it feels like Christmas !
... and that &apos;s the story of the <unk> . Now , some people <unk> the Christmas tree back to the <unk> , who used to bring green <unk> <unk> into their <unk> on the <unk> day of the year , <unk> life &apos;s triumph over death . And that was like <unk> years ago .
So , pretty much around the same time that you started telling this story .
Hey you guys .
Hey Joe what &apos;s up ?
I had to get out of the apartment . Janine is like stretching all over the place . Y &apos;know , everywhere I look she &apos;s like ...
I can see why that &apos;s hard to resist .
I like her so much !
Aw , I &apos;m sorry sweetie that she doesn &apos;t feel the same way .
I know . And she &apos;s so sweet . I just wanna feed her grapes and brush her hair .
You are aware that she &apos;s not a monkey , right ?
I am so over Janine . I mean , yeah , at first I thought she was hot , but now she &apos;s like <unk> <unk> !
Hey guys !
Hi Janine !

Yeah , that &apos;s what I said .
Oh my God ! We love that show ! I mean Ross and I have been watching it since I can remember !
Ah , you &apos;re still just a little fat girl inside aren &apos;t you ?

You &apos;re gonna be a party person ! Those guys rock the most !
Well they said I should bring someone . Do you wanna be my dance partner ?
Totally ! I would love to spend New Year &apos;s with you .
Well actually they &apos;re <unk> tomorrow . I don &apos;t really understand why .
Oh , well you see how it works is , the part with Dick Clark in Times Square is actually live , but they tape some of the party stuff ahead of time . Yeah , not a lot of people know that .
Yeah well , do you guys wanna come too ?
Are you serious ?
We are there !
What , what are you laughing at ?
Well , I used to date him , but you &apos;re still going out with her !

Did she just ask me out on a date ?
I don &apos;t think so .
What are you talking about ? She just invited him to the biggest party of the <unk> !
Yeah , but she also invited you and Ross . Yeah , honey , I &apos;m sorry , but I don &apos;t think that was a romantic thing .
Oh . Maybe . But hey I know how I can find out . We &apos;re going to a New Year &apos;s Eve party , right ? So at midnight , I can kiss her . And if she kisses me back , great ! Y &apos;know ? But if she says &apos; Dude , what the hell are you doing ? &apos; I can say &apos; It wasn &apos;t me , it was New Years ! &apos;
Well , that &apos;s a lot better than Ross trying to kiss me in High School , and saying that he did it because he needed <unk> .
It was a dry day .
We are going to Dick Clark &apos;s New Year &apos;s <unk> Eve !
Oh my God !

Chandler , that &apos;s not enough . I mean what if she gets you a great present , two medium presents , and a bunch of little presents ? And you &apos;ve just gotten her one great present ? I mean that &apos;s just gonna make her feel bad . Why would you do that to her Chandler ? Why ? Why ?

They said stuff to me too , y &apos;know !

Hey , you &apos;re not going to believe this . I made up a joke and sent it in to Playboy . They printed it !
I didn &apos;t know Playboy <unk> jokes .
Yeah , they print jokes , interviews , <unk> <unk> . It &apos;s not just about the pictures .
That didn &apos;t work on mom , it &apos;s not going to work on us .

That is funny . It was also funny when I made it up .
What ?
I made that joke up .
Uh , <unk> , no you didn &apos;t . I did .
Yes , I did . I told it to Dan at work , and he said it was the <unk> joke he &apos;d ever heard .
Hey , tell Dan , &apos; Thanks . &apos;
What ?
I &apos;m sorry , I was just reading the joke <unk> it . Man , that one is funny .
Monica , you remember me telling you that joke , right ?
No .
Seriously ?
Well , you tell a lot of jokes !
Look , Chandler , it &apos;s my joke . But , hey , if it makes you feel any better they don &apos;t print the name , so it doesn &apos;t really matter who gets credit , right ?
Yeah , I guess .
Hey guys .
Hey , Joey , Playboy printed my joke .
No , it &apos;s my joke , it &apos;s mine . You can call them , they &apos;ll tell you .
It &apos;s my joke .
It &apos;s my joke .
Whoa-whoa-whoa . <unk> ? You guys know they have naked chicks in there , right ?
Dude , you have got to turn on <unk> the Music . The band Heart is having a really tough time , and I think they may break up .
Let &apos;s go watch it at your place .
Nah , Monica &apos;s watching some cooking show . Come on , I don &apos;t want to miss when they were <unk> .
Chandler , Chandler , y &apos;know what we should do ? You and I should go out and get some new sunglasses .
What ? No , I want to watch this . . Did your <unk> go out ?
No , that &apos;s <unk> . I gotta tell you , the music these kids listen to today . . . It &apos;s like a lotta noise to me . I don &apos;t know ...
Joey , why is your <unk> out ?
I uh , oh ! Because , uh , I haven &apos;t really paid the bill
If you need money , will you please-please just let me loan you some money ?
No , Chandler . Look , forget about it , okay ? Look , I know things have been a little tight since Janine moved out . Oh , was she hot .
Whoa ho .
I know ! Yeah , but , look I can handle it . All right ? Look , I can listen to the radio , huh ? And Ross gave me this great book .
All right , you want to see if the joke <unk> will let us watch the show at his place ?
Sure .
<unk> your phone bill ?
Not so much .
Hey .
It &apos;s only you .
Wh-wh-what are you doing ?
We are looking at a Playboy .
Oh , I want to look too ! . Yikes !
So do you think that these <unk> , are they trying to tell a story ?
Oh , yeah , sure . I mean , like in the case of this young woman , she has lost her clothes , so she <unk> naked on the horse , she &apos;s crying out , &apos; Where are they , where are they ? &apos;
Well , she &apos;s not going to find them lying in the grass like that .
Oh , yeah . Aw , remember the days when you used to go out to the <unk> , lift up your shirt , and bend over ?
Yeah .
You see , now , I would date this girl . She &apos;s cute , she &apos;s <unk> , you know , and she knows how to build a fire . I mean , that &apos;s got to come in handy
Okay , I &apos;ve got a question . If you had to pick one of us to date , who would it be ?
I don &apos;t know .
Me neither .
Rachel .
What ? !
I don &apos;t know . Me neither .
You forget how many great songs Heart had .
Yeah .
You know , <unk> was the first song I learned to play on the <unk> .
So , you heard it , you <unk> it , so that must mean you wrote it .
Oh , you guys , with this joke . I gotta say , I know I cracked up , but I &apos;m not even sure I got it .
What , you didn &apos;t get it ? The doctor is a monkey .
And <unk> can &apos;t write out <unk> .
You are not allowed to laugh at my joke .
Your joke ? Well , I think &apos; the <unk> &apos; would disagree , which is why he sent me a check for one hundred <unk> .
So , you stole my joke , and you stole my money .
Well , I was going to stick it in the ATM , but now I think I &apos;ll show the sexy <unk> that I am a published <unk> .
Well , she is going to know that you stole the joke .
Oh , what are you going to do , follow me down there ?
Yeah !
Well , I &apos;m not going to go now anyway .
Okay .
Here you go .
Ah , Gunther , I can &apos;t pay for this right now because I &apos;m not working , so I &apos;ve had to cut down on some <unk> like uh , <unk> &apos; for stuff .
Well , if you want , you can work here .
Uh , I don &apos;t know . Ya see , it &apos;s just , see I was a regular on a soap opera y &apos;know ? And to go from that to this , I just ... Plus , I &apos;d have to wait on all my friends .
Okay , but the money &apos;s good , plus you get to stare at Rachel as much as you want .
What ? !
<unk> hours .
Maybe I could be a waiter . Could I use the phone ?
She picked Rachel . I mean , she tried to back out of it , but it was obvious . She picked Rachel .
He took my joke , he took it .
It &apos;s wrong . You know what else is wrong ? Phoebe picking Rachel .
You know who else picked Rachel ? Ross , and you know what else Ross did ? He stole my joke . You know what ? I &apos;m going to get a joke journal . Y &apos;know ? And <unk> the date and time of every single one of my jokes .
That &apos;s a good idea .
Yeah !
Do you know what &apos;s a bad idea ?
<unk> Rachel .
That &apos;s right . Did you hear something ?
Maybe it &apos;s the sound of Ross climbing into my brain and stealing my thoughts .
It &apos;s coming from the living room .
I finished my book .
Hey , you guys .
Hey .
Oh , don &apos;t you guys look cute . You guys make such a cute couple .
Monica , what are you doing ?
Nothing , I &apos;m just trying to <unk> some of the fun that we had at my place the other day . Remember , when you picked Rachel over me ? That was funny .
I guess it was kinda funny .
It wasn &apos;t funny at all ! Why would you do that ? Why didn &apos;t you pick me ?
Fine . The reason that I was <unk> a little bit more toward Rachel than you is just that you &apos;re ... just ... kinda high <unk> let &apos;s go to lunch !
That is completely <unk> . You think I &apos;m high maintenance ? Okay , prove it . I want you to make a list and we &apos;re going to go through it point by point !
No , okay , you &apos;re right . You &apos;re easy-going . You &apos;re just not as easy-going as Rachel . She &apos;s just more <unk> and-and <unk> . That &apos;s all .
Well , people are different .
Ya , you know , Rachel ... she &apos;ll do whatever you want . Y &apos;know , you can just walk all over her .
What ? Wait a minute . What are you saying , that I &apos;m a pushover ? I &apos;m not a pushover .
Oh , okay , you &apos;re not a pushover .
Oh my ... you think I &apos;m a pushover . Well wait , watch this , you know what ? You &apos;re not invited to lunch . What do you think of that ? I think that &apos;s pretty strong , that &apos;s what I think . Come on , Monica , let &apos;s go to lunch .
You start working on that list .
I cannot believe her .
I know . Where do you wanna go eat ?
Oh , oh , I love that Japanese place .
I &apos;m sick of Japanese . We &apos;re not going there .
All right , <unk> you wanna go is cool .
All right .
Oh , hey , Gunther , check this out .
Yeah , that-that Chandler cracks me up .
Hey Ross , listen , you want anything to drink , &apos; cause I &apos;m heading up there .
Uh , yeah , I &apos;ll take a coffee . Thanks , man .
Sure . Coffee ? &apos; Cause I &apos;m going up there .

You guys need anything , &apos; cause I &apos;m heading up there .
I &apos;d love an ice water .
You got it .
Joey , what are you doing ?
Just being friendly .
Joey , honey , I don &apos;t think you &apos;re supposed to go back there .
Nah , it &apos;s okay . Right , Gunther ?
Don &apos;t wink at me . And put on your <unk> .
Okay , but I don &apos;t see you asking any other paying <unk> to put on <unk> .
Joey , do you work here ?
No .
Hey , waiter .
Yeah ?
Joey , what &apos;s going on . What didn &apos;t you tell us you work here ?
It &apos;s kind of embarrassing , y &apos;know . I mean , I was an actor and now I &apos;m a waiter . It &apos;s supposed to go in the other direction .
So is your <unk> . You &apos;re wearing it like a <unk> .
I mean , the job &apos;s easy and the money &apos;s good , you know ? I guess I &apos;m going to be hanging out here anyway . I might as well get paid for it , right ? I just feel kind of weird serving you guys .
Come on , Joey , I did it and it was fine .
Yeah , why would it be weird ? Hey , Joey , can I get some coffee ?
Okay , I guess it doesn &apos;t seem that weird .
Seriously , I-I asked you before and you still haven &apos;t gotten it .
See , now it &apos;s weird again .
I Think It &apos;s Great That You <unk> Here . You <unk> Going To Make A <unk> Of <unk> , And Here &apos;s Your First <unk> . Don &apos;t eat yellow snow . . Ah ha ha , 2 : 15 , coffeehouse .
Well , you know what ? This is great . Finally , I have someone I can pass on my <unk> too . Let me tell you about a couple of things I learned while working at the coffeehouse . First of all , the customer is always right . A smile goes a long way . And if anyone is ever rude to you ? <unk> muffin .
Thanks , Rach . Look , you guys are just terrific . Y &apos;know ? Now , how about clearing out of here so I can get some new <unk> . It &apos;s all about <unk> .
Joey , seriously , can I get my coffee ?
Oh , I &apos;m sorry , Ross . I &apos;ll get it for you right now . And since I made you wait , I &apos;ll toss in a free muffin .
Phoebe . We would like to talk to you for a second .
Okay .
So , maybe I am a little high maintenance . And maybe Rachel is a little bit of a pushover . But you know what we decided you are ?
Yes , we are very sorry to tell you this , but you , Phoebe , are flaky .
<unk> !
That true , I am flaky .
So , what , you &apos;re just , you &apos;re just okay with being flaky ?
Yeah , totally .
Well , then , I &apos;m okay with being high maintenance .
Yeah , and I am okay with being a pushover .
That &apos;s great . Good for you guys .
I am not high maintenance !
I am not a pushover !
Who said you were ?
You did !
Oh , I &apos;m flaky . I &apos;ll say anything .
Hey , Gunther . Can you uh , can you cover for me ? I just got an audition .
No , I &apos;m leaving to get my hair <unk> .
Really ? ! I like your natural color . Come on man , it &apos;s a great part . Look , check it out . I &apos;m the lead guy &apos;s best friend and I wait for him in this bar and save his seat . <unk> . &apos; I &apos;m sorry , that seat &apos;s saved . &apos;
That &apos;s the whole part ?
Okay , maybe he &apos;s not his best friend , but ...
Okay , I &apos;ll see you in an hour .
Oh , man , I could totally get that part . &apos; I &apos;m sorry , that seat is taken . &apos;
Oh , excuse me .
No , no , I didn &apos;t mean you . But , you believed me , huh ?
I believed you were saving this seat for someone .
So , you &apos;d hire me , right ?
For what ?
Exactly ! All right , everybody , listen up . The coffeehouse is going to be closed for about an hour .
Huh ? What ?
Yeah , it &apos;s for the kids . To keep the kids off drugs . It &apos;s a very important <unk> in this month &apos;s Playboy . I &apos;m sure you all read about it .
It &apos;s my joke .
It &apos;s my joke .
It &apos;s my joke .
Y &apos;know , I don &apos;t think we &apos;re going to settle this .
Let &apos;s have Monica decide .
Yeah !
Yeah !
Hey Mon .
Mon , get out here !
Monica !
Okay , okay . You have to help us decide whose joke this is .
Why do I have to decide ?
Because you &apos;re the only one that can be fair .
Yeah .
I can &apos;t be fair . You &apos;re my boyfriend .
Yeah , but I &apos;m your brother . We &apos;re family . That &apos;s the most important thing in the world .
Don &apos;t try to <unk> her . I &apos;m your only chance to have a baby . Okay , let &apos;s go .
We &apos;ll each tell you how we came up with the joke and then you decide which one of us is telling the <unk> .
Okay , Chandler , you go first .
Okay , I thought of the joke two months ago at lunch with Steve .
Oh , wait , is he the guy I met at Christmas ?
Can I finish my story ? !
Do you want me to pick you ? !
See , I would never snap at you like that .
<unk> .
So Steve said he had to go to the doctor . And Steve &apos;s doctor &apos;s name is Doctor <unk> . So I said , &apos; Doctor Monkey ? &apos; And that is how the whole Doctor Monkey thing came up .
Are you kidding ? Okay , look . I-I <unk> <unk> . Remember , <unk> ? Monkey into man ? Plus , I &apos;m a doctor , and I had a monkey . I &apos;m Doctor Monkey !
I &apos;m not arguing with that .
All right , I &apos;ve heard enough . I &apos;ve made my decision .
You are both idiots . The joke is not funny , and it &apos;s offensive to women , and doctors , and <unk> ! You shouldn &apos;t be arguing over who gets credit , you should be arguing over who gets <unk> for <unk> this horrible joke upon the world ! Now let it go ! The joke sucks !
It &apos;s your joke .
Is not .
Hi , Chandler . There you are .
Hi , oh hi .
Hey , it &apos;s Phoebe and Rachel . Um , why don &apos;t you tell them what you were telling me earlier about me not being high maintenance ?
Monica is a <unk> , together lady . <unk> with her has been like being on a vacation . And what may be <unk> as high maintenance is <unk> attention to detail <unk> of spirit .
Wow , you know what ? That is the best fake speech I think I &apos;ve ever heard .
Really ? I &apos;ve heard better .
Wait , wait , he came up with that himself . Tell them , Chandler .
I &apos;m out of words . Should I just say the whole thing again ?
Look , I am not high maintenance . I am not . Chandler !
You &apos;re a little high maintenance .
Ahhh ! You are on my list .
I &apos;m sorry . You &apos;re not easy-going , but you &apos;re passionate , and that &apos;s good . And when you get upset about the little things , I think that I &apos;m pretty good about making you feel better about that . And that &apos;s good too . So , they can say that you &apos;re high maintenance , but it &apos;s okay , because I like ... <unk> you .
I didn &apos;t even tell him to say that . . All right you &apos;re off my list .
I &apos;m off the list .
Phoebe , it &apos;s okay that you don &apos;t want me to be your girlfriend because I have the best boyfriend .
Y &apos;know , suddenly I find you very attractive .
Hey , buddy boy , how &apos;d the audition go ?
Not good , no . I didn &apos;t get the part , and I lost my job here , so ...
Wow ! That is a bad audition .
How-how did you lose your job here ?
Well , I had the audition but Gunther said I had to stay here and be in charge so he could go get his hair <unk> . So , I went anyway , and then he fired me .
He left work in the middle of the day to do a personal <unk> and left you in charge when you &apos;ve been working here two days ? That &apos;s not , that &apos;s not right .
Yeah , what are ya gonna do ?
Joey , you can &apos;t let him get away with that . Ya know what , I &apos;m not going to let him get away with that . I &apos;m going to say something to <unk> , I really shouldn &apos;t say <unk> , I should say something to him . Gunther , I want you to give Joey his job back . That is really not fair that you have to fire him ...
Okay .
What ?
He can have his job back .
That &apos;s right , he can have his job back . I &apos;m glad we got that all <unk> out . There you go , Joey , you got your job back .
That &apos;s great . Thanks Rach .
Yeah , pretty nice , huh ? Now who &apos;s a pushover ?
Rach , you &apos;re in my seat .
Oh , I &apos;m sorry .
Hey , I never got to hear who you guys would pick to be your girlfriend .
I pick you , Phoebe .
Oh , yeah . Definitely you , Pheebs .
Yeah , well , I kinda thought .

Oh that &apos;s on the house <unk> of Joey Tribbiani .

No ! No ! I just went to pick up Phoebe Buffay &apos;s <unk> ; there were a lot of them .
Nice !
<unk> , and I won &apos;t have to go there anymore because I gave them my correct address .
That &apos;s great , but isn &apos;t it gonna bother that people still think you &apos;re a porn star ?
Oh no ! No ! I know how to handle it .
You do ?
Yeah . You &apos;re trying to figure out where you know me from ? All right , I &apos;ll give you a hint . From porn ! Okay ? Yeah your pervert boyfriend watched me in a <unk> movie ! See ?
Yeah .
Hey .
You uh , you may have been right about Jill .
Oh ! I knew it ! What happened ?
Umm , she kissed me .
What ? ! You kissed !
Maybe we should give them some privacy .
Shhhh ! ! !
Look , I uh , I tried not to kiss her , okay ?
Well , it doesn &apos;t sound like it ! I mean , it &apos;s pretty easy not to kiss someone , you just don &apos;t kiss them ! See look at us , right now , not kissing !
Let me finish , okay ? She started kissing me and-and I didn &apos;t stop it . I guess I-I just wasn &apos;t thinking ...
Yeah that &apos;s right you weren &apos;t thinking ! Y &apos;know what ? Let me give you something to think about !
Oh <unk> it ! But then I started thinking and I stopped the kissing .
Oh , well thank you for taking your tongue out of my sister &apos;s mouth long enough to tell me that .
Look I-I realize if anything were to happen with me and Jill then nothing could ever happen with us !
What ? !
No , I mean , look I don &apos;t know if anything is going to happen with us , again . Ever . But I don &apos;t want to know that it-it never could . So I stopped it and she got mad and broke my <unk> .
Wow . I , I don &apos;t even know what to say . Thank you .
You &apos;re welcome .
Oh my God ! Are-are you crying ?
I just don &apos;t see why those two can &apos;t work things out !
All right , I &apos;m leaving ! Because I &apos;m not going to spend one more day with someone whose out to <unk> my every move . That &apos;s you Rachel !
Yeah , I got that .
And you ! I throw myself at you and you say no , how gay are you ?
You take care Jill .
Okay , see ya !

Oh my God !
Wow !
What is the matter with you ? !
No ! Barry and Mindy .
Oh sorry , I hear divorce I <unk> go to Ross . Who-who &apos;s Barry and Mindy ?
Barry was the guy that I was almost married and Mindy was my best friend .
<unk> , wasn &apos;t he cheating on you with her ?
Yeah , but that just means that he was falling asleep on top of her instead of me .
Why did they get divorced ?
Well , apparently she caught him cheating on her with someone else . Isn &apos;t that sad ? God , could you imagine if I actually married him ? ! I mean how different would my life be ?
I know what you mean , I &apos;ve always wondered how different my life would be if-if I &apos;d never gotten divorced .
Which time ?
The first time ! No seriously , imagine if Carol hadn &apos;t realized she was a lesbian .
I can &apos;t . I keep seeing it the good way .
I &apos;d bet I &apos;d still be doing my kara-tay . <unk> the end of our marriage I was doing a lot of kara-tay as a way of <unk> the <unk> from y &apos;know , not doing anything else physical .
Maybe the problem was you were <unk> it kara-tay .
And what if I was still fat ? Well , you wouldn &apos;t be dating me , that &apos;s for sure .
Sure I would !
Oh yeah ! Come on ! Yeah right !
What , you guys really think that I &apos;m that shallow ?
No , I just think Monica was that fat .
Hey , imagine if I never got fired off Days Of Our Lives ! <unk> , there &apos;s Carol again !
What if I had had the guts to quit my job ? I &apos;d probably be writing for the New <unk> , getting paid to be funny . But my job &apos;s fun too ! I mean tomorrow , I-I don &apos;t have to wear a tie .
What if I had taken that job at <unk> <unk> ?
What ? !
<unk> <unk> ?
Yeah , I had a massage client who worked there and-and he said I had a <unk> for <unk> .
Well why didn &apos;t you take the job ?
Because at that time you see , I thought everything that <unk> was true . So I thought y &apos;know that if I &apos;d work with <unk> , I &apos;d have to live in a box , and only eat <unk> , and have a pet fox .
Hey , do you guys think that if all those things happened , we &apos;d still hang out ?
Oh my God ! Rachel Green ?

Hmm , pulling in a <unk> in the high six figures or rubbing gross naked people for <unk> <unk> , what do I do ? ! What will I do ? !
Ohh , I mean it &apos;s just so realistic !

Wow ! I can &apos;t , I can &apos;t feel my hands .
Come , come here .
We can &apos;t do this .
No ! <unk> ?
Yeah ! If-if-if we did do this there would be a lot of pressure on me , y &apos;know ? Because you &apos;ve been waiting a very long time and I wouldn &apos;t want to <unk> you .
Yeah but see I have nothing to compare it too . So even if you &apos;re horrible , how would I know ?
I do like that .
It &apos;s harder for me ! I have those four other women to compete with !

There was just one woman , wasn &apos;t there ?

Come on Ross . We &apos;re sorry . Please tell us what it is .
Unagi is a state of total <unk> . Okay ? Only by <unk> true unagi can you be prepared for any danger that may <unk> you !
You mean in case someone is trying to steal your <unk> sleeping <unk> or your <unk> of fish ?
All I &apos;m saying is , it &apos;s one thing being prepared for an attack against like each other ; whole another story being prepared for an attack , I don &apos;t know , like a surprise ! !
All right , you know that one was coming , but that doesn &apos;t mean you have unagi .
Ooh ! Y &apos;know what ? If we made reservations , we could have unagi in about a half-hour .
Y &apos;know what ...
Hey-hey , is Monica here ?
No .

Okay , look I need your help , I don &apos;t know what to get her for Valentine &apos;s Day .

The nerve huh ?
Yeah !
<unk> ?
Now , this is last minute so I want to apologize for the mess . Okay ?
Oh my God ! It sure didn &apos;t look this way when I lived here .
I know ! Now look , there &apos;s only one problem though . There &apos;s only room for one , so I guess one of you will have to stay at Joey &apos;s .
Well , since the fire was kinda my fault I guess you should get to stay here .
Hey ! Hey-hey , now this was no one &apos;s fault Pheebs . Okay ? It was an accident .
Well no , it was my fault so you should get the nice room .
Okay !
So Rach ! You &apos;re the first guest at <unk> Monica ! Umm , you &apos;ll just have to tell me how you like your eggs in the morning . And I thought I would bring them to you , y &apos;know , in bed . Oh , you have been through so much .
I have .
This right here is where I keep the pizza . And uh that &apos;s where the napkin is .
What &apos;s that smell ?
I know !
Oh please ! It was such a big class ! You never even noticed me !
What ? Of course I did ! You uh , you sat next to <unk> <unk> .
Who ?
Oh uh , I had trouble remembering everyone &apos;s name , so I-I kinda came up with <unk> . Like the guy on the other side of you was Smelly <unk> <unk> .
Oh yeah . So umm , did you have a nickname for me ?
Umm , no . No .
Yes you did ! What was it ?
Umm , it &apos;s <unk> <unk> .
Ohh that &apos;s so sweet !
Listen , I gotta tell ya , I-I &apos;m having a great time ! Y &apos;know how before you said it might be weird , the whole student teacher thing , and to be <unk> I thought it would be too , but it &apos;s not . I mean it &apos;s not at all .
Dr. Geller !
<unk> !
So did you sleep well last night ?
I did .
Yeah ?
I did , Monica was so sweet she left a little mint on my pillow .
Y &apos;know what Joey left on my pillow ?
What ?
<unk> !
Well , we <unk> the cause of the fire .
Yeah I know , it was my candle . My candle !
No , there was an <unk> left on in the bathroom . It &apos;s looks like a curling iron .
I don &apos;t use a curling iron .
Well someone does .
Well , don &apos;t look at me ! My hair &apos;s straight ! Straight ! Straight ! Straight !
It could &apos;ve been a hair straightener .
Oh .
This is where I keep the pizza . <unk> ! Where did the napkin go ? !
Now there you go ! I wouldn &apos;t want my best guest to <unk> her eyes !
Thanks Monica !
Does that smell bother you ?
What the smell from Joey &apos;s ? No , I can hardly smell it over here .
Well you let me know if you can , because y &apos;know I can bake a pie to cover it .
I can smell it a little , bake the pie .
Okay !
Okay .
Hello ? Oh yes , one minute please . It &apos;s for you . It &apos;s the fire inspector .
Oh ! Hello ? Yeah this is Phoebe . Really ? !
Yeah , so it turns out that it wasn &apos;t the hair straightener that started the fire . No-no , it was the candles . It &apos;s very not good leaving candles <unk> . In fact , one of the first things they teach you in fire school is ... Uhh ... Uhh ... Okay . Well , I have to go now .
We had such a great time ! She &apos;s-she &apos;s incredible ! I thought the-the age difference might be a problem , but it wasn &apos;t . It wasn &apos;t at all . Elizabeth is very mature for her age . A concept lost on some people !
So it &apos;s okay to date a student .
Well , not really . I mean technically it &apos;s-it &apos;s not against the rules or anything , but it is frowned upon . Especially by that professor we ran into last night , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Well Ross , you be careful now . You don &apos;t want to get a <unk> as y &apos;know Professor <unk> .
Yeah . What-what should I do ?
Well Ross , it seems pretty clear . I mean what &apos;s more important ? What people think or how you feel , huh ? Ross , you gotta follow your heart .

Y &apos;know uh , actually I-I-I should get going .
Oh no-no-no ! Stay ! Stay ! Because you-you should you-you-you should stay !
Wow . Oh , I am really <unk> , but I just I don &apos;t feel that way about you .
Oh no-no-no , that &apos;s <unk> !

Well , I umm , I mean this is just off the top of my head now , umm but I have this friend . This actor friend and he would kill me if he thought I was doing this umm , but umm would it be possible for him to get an audition for your movie say on Thursday ?
Absolutely ! But you-you would really feel better about me rejecting you if your actor friend can audition for my movie ?
Well , the heart wants what it wants . I &apos;ll see you later .
Hey ! How &apos;s it goin &apos; ?
Well , not much has changed in the last five minutes .
Yes it has ! I made cookies !

Rach ! Hey ! It &apos;s fine ! You &apos;re at Joey &apos;s !
Really ?

You see , I didn &apos;t , I didn &apos;t tell you but umm , but I-I had recently <unk> the tissues and so y &apos;know let &apos;s just face it , that &apos;s just <unk> ! So I think it &apos;s better that I stay at Joey &apos;s .
No , no-no-no . Phoebe , this was my fault and besides y &apos;know what ? I &apos;m fine here .
Okay . Oh umm , Chandler , Monica is looking for you .

Stupid ! I can &apos;t believe it ! God ! Hey , how you doin &apos; ?
So it seemed that my <unk> date had stood me up , so Ross <unk> , offered to take me .
What a nice story !
So Ross was in college and decided to jump at the chance to take a young girl to her high school <unk> .
Wow ! I definitely did not see that one <unk> ! I &apos;m gonna go to the bathroom .
Yeah , take your time .
Just-just so you know I was a <unk> and she was a <unk> . So it wasn &apos;t as bad as-as ...
Ross , look , I know I &apos;ve been giving you a lot of <unk> and it &apos;s partly because I &apos;m very protective of Lizzie , and partly because well , they just keep coming to me . But I have to admit that after all the wonderful things that Lizzie has told me and the many , many , many stories that Rachel has told me that , well you &apos;re not all bad .
Not all bad .
And <unk> , I &apos;m sorry I was so <unk> before , but you have to understand that I still look at Lizzie like she &apos;s a <unk> girl .
Yeah . You know what ? I know what you mean ; I do that too .
I beg your <unk> ?
No ! No ! <unk> don &apos;t mean I-I see her as a <unk> girl ! I mean I-I have a son , who &apos;s umm six and I still think of him as a baby .
You have a son ?
Yeah , well my-my ex-wife and I share custody of Ben and umm , uh , and just so you know , Carol and I are on excellent terms as I &apos;m sure you are with your wife ! Oh , I &apos;m sorry ! It &apos;s unbelievable !
Don &apos;t worry about it , I just didn &apos;t realize you were married .
Oh we were , but that was just a , I mean that was just a big drunken mistake .
You &apos;re back .
You two were married ? !
Oh ! Whoops ! I &apos;m sorry , you were talking about Emily !
Chandler , we said we would meet at the coffeehouse at six .
We said seven !
We said six !
The only way that I said six would be if the seven &apos;s , let meet at seven , not at six .
Yeah and if I had seven , maybe I would &apos;ve said something like this , &quot; Wow ! My boyfriend &apos;s such a <unk> <unk> ! &quot;
Hi !
Oh my good God .
Ugh !
I know what time you said .
What ? !
Well actually , I know what time Chester and Marcia said .
What time ?
<unk> an interesting turn of <unk> , suddenly it &apos;s my book to the rescue , huh ? Ooh , very interesting . Yeah , well this certainly <unk> things up .
What does it say ? !
I will tell you as soon as you thank me for writing my book .
Thank you for writing your book . <unk> uh , great book and you are the queen of everything .
Thanks ! So are you .
I told you I should not wear this color .
Mon ... Marcia and Chester are planning on seeing a movie on Sunday night . Marcia thinks they &apos;re supposed to meet at six , Chester thinks it &apos;s at seven .
So you knew we were gonna miss the movie !
That &apos;s right .
<unk> of telling us you decided to write in your stupid book !
Marcia and Chester are mad at Phyllis .
I can &apos;t believe I &apos;m going to lose this job !
Oh I &apos;m so sorry man ! Is there anything I can do ?
Yeah ! Help me get this <unk> past the security guard .
Hey Joey , I want to talk to you .
Yeah ? Well , I don &apos;t want to talk to you Wayne ! I hate you ! You ruined my life ! Oh , Chandler , Wayne . Wayne , Chandler .
Hi , how are ya ?
Joey , Joey , I-I-I &apos;ll <unk> you your job back if you help me out .
Why should I help you ? !
The reason he just said .
What do you need ?
I-I-I saw you on stage talking to that beautiful woman , y &apos;know Sarah ?
Yeah ?
I wish I could talk to her .
What are you in love with her or something ?
Yeah . Her . All of them . Anyone .
Yeah , I &apos;ve been there my friend .
Listen , I-I guarantee you keep your job if you can teach me how to talk to women like you do .
Oh wow Wayne , it &apos;s not really something you can teach y &apos;know ? It &apos;s pretty much something you &apos;re born with if <unk> can teach it ! I &apos;ll show you right how to do it .
I mean if you think about it , I mean Ross did learn something from each marriage .
How to make the next one even shorter ?
Now wait a minute that &apos;s not fair . He was married to me a hell of a lot longer than he was married to Emily , he just didn &apos;t tell me . Maybe I have to pee again .
Well , this is fun . So Ross , did you kill any of these <unk> ?
Y &apos;know what ? I-I-I ... I-I have had enough of this ! Y &apos;know , I-I-I care a great deal about your daughter and I have treated her with nothing but respect ! So if-if you &apos;ve got a problem with me , <unk> ...
Are you yelling at me ? !
God no !
Y &apos;know what daddy ? If you don &apos;t like Ross , that &apos;s fine . It doesn &apos;t matter to me , I &apos;m gonna go out with him anyway .
Really ? !
Well if it doesn &apos;t matter to her , it doesn &apos;t matter to me ! Still not yelling !
Wow . What can I say ? This doesn &apos;t make me like you any better !
That &apos;s okay , I &apos;m not so crazy about myself right now either .
Then we agree ?
Uh yeah , I <unk> ! I guess so .
Neither of us like Ross !
I like Ross .
Ohhh ! Kids !
Wait-wait-wait , I just thought of another story about how nice Ross is !
That &apos;s okay Rach , we &apos;re not liking Ross right now .
Oh ! I &apos;ve got a lot of those too !
Well , it turns out you were right C.H.E.E.S.E.
The <unk> never made it through <unk> ?
You got it ! And the <unk> &apos;s beard , 100 % <unk> . Nice catch C.H.E.E.S.E. ! It &apos;s your line C.H.E.E.S.E. ! Wayne ! Wayne ! !
Hi , you guys .
Hey !
Hi !
What &apos;s the matter ?
Well it &apos;s just-it &apos;s one of those <unk> that I just hate . Y &apos;know ? A massage client gave me three tickets to the <unk> exhibit at the Morgan Chase museum .
Now you &apos;re thinking you gotta sleep with him .
No ! No ! It &apos;s just that he gave me three tickets and there are six of us !
I &apos;ll give up my ticket .
Me too .
Okay that &apos;s so generous !
And I think Ross is generous too .
Great ! Okay then it &apos;s just us girls !
Great .
Yeah .
So what-what is the exhibit .
It &apos;s mostly just <unk> of lesbian love <unk> <unk> with video games and free sandwiches .
Oh man !
Hey !
Hi !
Hey !
Hey Ross listen Chandler got you out of going to the lesbian sandwich museum this weekend !
Thanks ? But I have plans ; Elizabeth and I are going out of town .
Oh that &apos;s great !
Yeah .
I mean think about all the money that you &apos;re gonna make !
Why ? What ?
Well , her father pays you for <unk> right ?
No , no , that &apos;s funny . But maybe it &apos;s time to move on , let it go , y &apos;know ? Stop it ! Besides , Rachel is going out with Elizabeth &apos;s father , so ah , he &apos;s much older than she is . Looks like I &apos;m not the only one interested in fossils , huh ?
I mean Ross all that does is <unk> us that you are interested in fossils .
Okay , okay . Uh , well uh , Rachel is going to need to yell sweet <unk> in his ear .
Ross .
Oh , come on you guys ; that &apos;s funny ! Y &apos;know ? Because he &apos;s <unk> &apos;s got like a hearing <unk> y &apos;know , &apos; <unk> &apos; cause y &apos;know , &apos; cause he &apos;s all old , and ...
Okay look , Ross , just so you know that since Lizzie likes you so much , I &apos;ve decided to accept the fact that you &apos;re going out with her .
Really ? That okay , that &apos;s great .
Yeah . But then I changed my mind . I &apos;m funny like that . So I told Lizzie , now I &apos;m telling you , I don &apos;t want you seeing my daughter anymore .
All right look , I-I realize it <unk> you .
Yes it does .
But , Elizabeth and I are-are both <unk> and so I don &apos;t think there &apos;s really anything you can do about it .
I &apos;ll call the university and tell them about your relationship and have you fired .
Ohh ! A man with a plan !
Oh , this is so exciting ! You get your picture back up on the wall of <unk> ! <unk> !
I know . It was so cool when I was up there before . Me and Jim <unk> would just be <unk> &apos; up about something ... Then I get fired off of Days Of Our Lives and he takes me down . Now he &apos;s just laughing at me . Look at him , that <unk> <unk> bastard , I &apos;ll ...
Ohh , okay maybe they put your picture back up they can put you next to <unk> <unk> . Look at him , smiling at me . Yeah I know ; we &apos;d be great together !
Hey ! So I &apos;m back .

Oh wow . What , do you think maybe he &apos;s gonna tell you that he &apos;s gay ?
What ? ! No ! Why ? !
No reason ! That would just be a really big surprise , right ?
You can put the aisle over here , and put the wedding ceremony right over here .
I didn &apos;t know you could get married here .
This would be a beautiful place to get married , yeah , but I wouldn &apos;t put the aisle there and I would never have the ceremony there ! I mean you &apos;d have the ceremony under this big beautiful <unk> .
May I help you ?
Oh sorry didn &apos;t mean to interrupt . It &apos;s just such a beautiful space ; do you do a lot of <unk> here ?
Yes . We &apos;re very popular . There &apos;s a <unk> waiting list . Sorry !
Monica , you should totally put your name down on the list
What ? ! Are you crazy ? ! I &apos;m not getting married ! I &apos;m not even engaged .
Yeah , but there &apos;s a <unk> wait . And then what if you get engaged in two years and then you got to wait another two years for this place . That &apos;s four years . Chandler &apos;s not gonna wait that long . He &apos;s gonna find somebody else , y &apos;know ? Someone , someone who did put their name on the list .
Yeah hon , it can &apos;t hurt to put your name down ! I mean in if two years if you &apos;re not engaged you just don &apos;t use it .

I &apos;m gonna do it too !
Me too !

And I too am just a love machine .
Ross , let me show you where the guest room is .
I &apos;m so sorry . Please , stop freaking out .
I &apos;m not freaking out . Why would I be freaking out ? A woman named Heldi called and said we were getting married , but that happens everyday .
Honey , we were at this beautiful place , and I-I-I just put our names down for fun ! I mean , what &apos;s the harm in that ?
Right here !
Chandler , please don &apos;t think I was trying to pressure you . Phoebe and Rachel ...
Phoebe and Rachel ! So the people that knew about our wedding before me were you , Phoebe and Rachel , Heldi , and apparently some band called <unk> Magic 7 who are available by the way !
It was a mistake . Please don &apos;t take this to mean anything , because it doesn &apos;t .
Okay .
Really ?
Yes , if it really doesn &apos;t mean anything , because you know that I &apos;m just not ready ...
I know ! I know .
Okay .
I &apos;m gonna go tell Joey that that you &apos;re back . I was really worried about you .
Hey , did she buy it ?
Totally .
So did Heldi show you the place ?
Yeah , it &apos;s beautiful .
I can &apos;t believe you &apos;re gonna ask Monica to marry you !
I know .
Hey Gunther .
Hey ! Take these <unk> to table 11 and that guy over there wants the <unk> .
Oh uh , well I just came in for a cup of coffee to go .
Do you still work here ?
No ! No , I quit a long time ago . Did I forget to you that one ? I &apos;m sorry .
Oh that &apos;s cool , I was gonna fire you anyway .
Great !
Pheebs , can you help me pick out an engagement ring for Monica ? I can &apos;t figure this out ! It &apos;s so hard ! Should I get her a <unk> cut or a Princess cut or <unk> ! <unk> cut !
Now , have you told anyone else ?
No , I don &apos;t want to tell anybody else because I don &apos;t want Monica to find out .
You told me .
Well , it &apos;s because I trust you , you &apos;re one of my best friends , and you walked in on me when I was looking at ring <unk> .
Yeah well , once again not knocking pays off . I only wish you hadn &apos;t been on the toilet .
Me too .
Hey .
Hey .
Hey ! So Chandler , wanna go to the coffeehouse ?
Oh all right .
Yeah , coffeehouse .
Oh perfect , we were just gonna see if you wanted to go .
Oh well , we don &apos;t because we got ... the ... other <unk> .
How rude .
Oh , I &apos;m sorry . You wanna bite ?
So how are things going with Paul ?
Good . Although y &apos;know , he-he &apos;s a private guy . Y &apos;know , I wish I could get him to open up a little bit , share some feelings .
That &apos;s easy ! You just have to think of him as <unk> a jar of pickles that won &apos;t open .
So what are you saying ; I should run him under hot water and bang his head against a table ?
No that &apos;s what you do when you want to get the truth out of someone .
Hi honey .
Hi !
Watch this .
How are you ?
Okay .
Hi Paul !
Hi Phoebe .
So how are things going with you ?
Can &apos;t complain .
Come on .
Okay .
Hey !
Hi !
Ross !
Great to see you !
Good to see you too !
How you doing ?
Good . Bye !
Okay ! You take care !
Hey Pheebs , what-what was the deal with you and Chandler <unk> us off before ?
Yeah ! That was so weird , huh ?
Phoebe , why &apos;d you do it ?
I didn &apos;t do it ! It was Chandler ! He &apos;s ... He &apos;s mad at you !
What ? ! Why ? !
Please , I think you know why .
I can &apos;t think of anything .
Come on Ross , you &apos;re a paleontologist , dig a little <unk> .
Wait a minute , is it because Joey and I didn &apos;t invite him to that Knicks game a couple of weeks ago ?
Do you think that &apos;s something that he &apos;d be mad at you for ?
I guess it could .
Well then I think that &apos;s it .
Well , if he &apos;s angry , he really shouldn &apos;t just cover it up . I-I wish he would just tell me the truth .
Oh , if that &apos;s what you want you then you really should run his head under hot water and bang his head against a table .
Honey I made a <unk> at <unk> <unk> , is that okay ?
Yeah that &apos;s great . But first , wait , talk to me , talk to me . Tell me about your day .
It was fine .
Okay . Hey , what are you thinking ? What are you thinking right now ?

No Paul , I don &apos;t know anything about you ! Y &apos;know , like-like your childhood ! Tell me about your childhood !
<unk> .
Okay , well then how about <unk> ! Come on , that &apos;s always a painful time ! Y &apos;know your friends invite you to a <unk> party and then they stick your hand in warm water while you &apos;re sleeping so that you pee in your sleeping bag .
Nope ! That never happened to me !
Well , you &apos;re lucky you never met that bitch <unk> <unk> . Anyway , umm ... The rest of you life , y &apos;know ? Any regrets ?
Nope .
All right Paul , I &apos;m not asking for a lot here . Okay ? Just give me something . Anything !
Okay .

Okay . Well , apparently Chandler &apos;s angry at us for not getting him a ticket to that Knicks game a couple of weeks ago .
Oh , we &apos;re supposed to just get him a ticket ? ! That guy is always <unk> off of us !
Yeah ! Anyway , I-I still think we should try to patch things up , y &apos;know ? Like uh , maybe we could get him to get tickets to another Knicks game and invite him .
Oh wow that &apos;s a great idea ! And I still have his credit card .
Here you go .
Oh .

Still crying ?

Oh , that &apos;s uh , that &apos;s pretty nice but I &apos;m gonna go with the one I picked first .
Oh my God Chandler , the one you picked is gone . It &apos;s over !
What ?
Some guy bought it . I &apos;m sorry . I tired to stop it but they put me in jail !
They put you in jail ?
The little jail between the doors !
Phoebe , I asked you to guard the ring !
I know , I &apos;m sorry ! But y &apos;know , this ring is better ! Monica never even saw the other ring .
Yeah but when he <unk> to me with the ring I got <unk> bumps .
Maybe it was the guy .
It was the ring !
Hey ! So uh , was he excited about the tickets ?
No ! He blew us off !
What ? !
I know !
I can &apos;t believe it . Can I tell you something ? I &apos;m a little mad at him now .
Can I tell you something ? Me too .
Y &apos;know what ? He didn &apos;t want to talk to us about being angry , well maybe we don &apos;t talk to him at all !
Ooooh ! <unk> him out .
That &apos;s right !
I like it !
Eh ? We &apos;ll show him !
From now on , it &apos;s gonna be Joey and Ross , best friends . Okay ! We &apos;re gonna be the new Joey and Chandler .
Hi . I &apos;m back .

Ah that &apos;s great . No actually that &apos;s ... That &apos;s great ! That &apos;s really great ! Y &apos;know , I gotta tell ya writing , I mean writing , gets me uh , gets me kinda hot .
Wait ! Wait ! Listen ! Listen to this ! Y &apos;know what I wanted to be when I was that age ?
A lover ?
A <unk> .
Oh yeah <unk> ?
I wanted to be one with the waves , y &apos;know ?
Okay , hold on real quick , hold on a second let me just uh , get a little more comfortable here . Wait , now wait a second , this isn &apos;t too <unk> is it ?
No . What ever happened to that little dude . So full of dreams ...
I don &apos;t care about the little dude ! I can &apos;t ! I cannot listen to anymore of this ! Y &apos;know , the only person who would want to listen to this is a mental health professional ! And then it &apos;s only because they get paid $ 100 an hour ! Do you know how much money I could &apos;ve made listening to you ? $ 2,000 ! And do you know when I figured that out ? While you were talking !
What ? ! I can &apos;t believe you &apos;re trying to <unk> me ! When just 14 hours ago we figured out that that is exactly what my mother was trying to do to me !
Oh ... I &apos;m sorry . I ... I-I don &apos;t <unk> didn &apos;t mean to <unk> you . I ... This is all just a little overwhelming .
Oh Rachel , I &apos;m so sorry . I didn &apos;t mean to <unk> you . It &apos;s just that , when those <unk> open , you ... Hard to close &apos; em . But they are closed now . Believe me .
I &apos;m so glad , I &apos;m so glad you <unk> . And I &apos;m glad that you &apos;re done . What do you say we umm ...
I would really like that .
That was ... so good .
Hey .
I can &apos;t believe I let you talk me into buying this stupid gumball machine looking ring !
It &apos;s not a stupid gumball machine looking ring ! It &apos;s a beautiful ring !
No , it &apos;s not ! When I looked at the other ring I could see Monica &apos;s face when I gave it to her , y &apos;know ? And I could see her saying yes . When I look at this ring , all I see is a ring ! Unless I look at it really <unk> and then I can see my own eye . Look , this is the most important thing I &apos;m gonna do in my life . I wanna make sure it &apos;s perfect .
Okay . There may be a way that we can get the other ring back . &apos; Cause I heard the guy tell the <unk> where he was going to propose . So maybe we can get him to trade rings or something .
I can &apos;t do that .
Well you certainly can &apos;t give her that stupid gumball ring .
There he is !
Okay and he hasn &apos;t <unk> yet because she has no ring on her finger .
Wow ! You &apos;re good ! After this , we should solve crimes .
Yeah ! Okay , go , go , go get him .
Oh , okay . Excuse me sir ? Could you come with me please ? You have a phone call .
Who is it ?
It is your office .
Do you know who at my office ?
John ?
Oh John ! Great !
Here he is .
Hi ! Hi . Okay , there was a <unk> <unk> at the jewelry store , the ring you &apos;re about to propose with was supposed to be held for me . So , I &apos;m gonna need to have that back . But , in exchange I &apos;m willing to trade you this beautiful , more expensive ring . Ew .
Wow ! I would trade .
It is beautiful , but I &apos;m gonna use this one . Now , if you &apos;ll excuse me .
No-no ! This is my <unk> and her heart was set on that ring . You don &apos;t want to break her heart now do you ?
Yeah , do you want to break a dying woman &apos;s heart ?
You &apos;re dying ? !
Yeah , she &apos;s dying ... Of a cough apparently .
Yes , and it is my dying wish to have that ring . See , if I &apos;m not <unk> with that ring then my spirit is going to wander the <unk> world for all <unk> ...
Okay , that &apos;s enough honey !

Why would a charity give away a free boat ? !
I don &apos;t know ! <unk> ?
Ugh !
Well , just buy the damn boat !
Phoebe , don &apos;t you think you &apos;ve had enough to drink ?
I &apos;m just helping the kids !
How is you drinking helping the kids ?
Because the more I drink , the less there is for the kids to drink .
Mr. Tribbiani .
Oh hi !
Your generous <unk> brings us a big step closer to building the <unk> center .
Just out of curiosity , how-how much is that boat worth ?
I think it was <unk> at <unk>
Hey , I was pretty close . Uhh , so bad news . Umm , I can &apos;t buy the boat , I don &apos;t have any money .
Joey ! Joey , good one !
That &apos;s good . Very good !
So uh listen , I think I &apos;m gonna take off now .
Hey ! You ... can &apos;t ... leave Joey ! You agreed to buy that boat , all right ? ! That is a contract ! And plus if you leave , my boss is gonna kill me !
Well , what am I gonna do Rach ? ! I don &apos;t have that kind of money !
I know . Okay . Okay . Okay . All right . All right , this is what we &apos;re gonna do , we are gonna go to the next highest <unk> , and we are just gonna let them buy it , and then you &apos;re just gonna pay the difference .
Okay .
Okay .
Look , I don &apos;t know why the kids need a <unk> center anyway ! Y &apos;know ? They should just watch TV after school like I did and I turned out fine !
Not great .
And so , we &apos;re hiding in the bathroom .
And-and then I sneak out and before Monica can her parents come in .
So I hide in the shower and the next thing you know they &apos;re going at it right on the bathroom floor .
Oh my God !
I got a good one , I got a good one ! I once walked in on both my parents making love to the same guy .
It &apos;s so great seeing you guys again . I &apos;d like to make a toast . Uh , as a poet once said , &quot; In the <unk> of friendship , let there be <unk> and sharing of <unk> for in the due of little things the heart finds it &apos;s morning and is <unk> . &quot;
Ohh .
What ? !
Oh my God , you guys ! !
Before you say anything , have we got a story for you ! Guess who we bumped into at dinner !
Who ?
Richard !
What ? <unk> ! Ohh . Oh that &apos;s right that &apos;s right . That &apos;s Richard &apos;s favorite place too .
Oh you knew that . Good !
I thought you were going out with Elizabeth .
Yeah , I was but uh , she was a little busy with a water <unk> fight .
Oh Ross , sometimes <unk> have <unk> they just can &apos;t get out of !
Y &apos;know , maybe she is too young for me . Y &apos;know , when I was over there and she was running around with her friends , I felt like I was a <unk> . I finally started to see what you guys were talking about . I don &apos;t know what to do .
Why don &apos;t you just <unk> out the good stuff about the relationship against the bad stuff . I mean that &apos;s what I did when I first <unk> stuff .
Okay umm , bad stuff . Well , I &apos;m-I &apos;m 12 years older than she is .
If the school finds out you &apos;re fired .
Hmm .
She &apos;s leaving for three months .
For camp !
Okay , good stuff . Umm , well she &apos;s-she &apos;s sweet and pretty and ...
Look Ross , the only question you need to ask is , &quot; Do you see a future ? &quot; I mean like do you see yourself marrying her ? Oh my God ! You did it already ! You married her , didn &apos;t you ? !
No ! No ! I ... didn &apos;t do that . It &apos;s just ... Okay , honestly no . I don &apos;t , I don &apos;t see a big future with her .
Okay well I think ... that &apos;s your answer .
I &apos;ve got to talk to her . Ugh , I hate this part .
Hey , you have to forget about Elizabeth . I mean if you &apos;re not careful you may not get married at all this year !
Rach ! Rachel ! Okay , the next highest <unk> is at table one .

Good one ! Yeah .
This is terrible . What am I going to do ?
Look , she only <unk> something okay ? She doesn &apos;t know for sure , so just throw her off the track .
That &apos;s right , I can throw her off . I can make her think marriage is the last thing on my mind .
Yeah ! Yeah ! <unk> her that-that you &apos;re scared of commitment ! <unk> her that you &apos;re a little <unk> !
I can do that , I &apos;ve had 30 years of practice .
Hey , being you is finally gonna pay off !
I had to go all the way to the <unk> because some idiot keeps stuffing the trash chute with pizza boxes !
That guy &apos;s still doing that ? !
Hey ! Oh my God you &apos;re here , let me see your hand ! !
No , you &apos;re too late ! ! ! She already took out the trash ! ! !

Ross ! Wait !

Hey Monica , there &apos;s a customer who wants to complement the chef , should I let him in ?
Sure , I love this part !
Come on in .
Hi !
Richard !
Actually , I &apos;m not here to complement the chef .
Ohh ... Oh , that &apos;s okay I hate when people come back to complement the chef . Like I have nothing better to do ! So what &apos;s up ?
Well , it was great seeing you the other night .
Oh , good to see you too . Did you come down here to tell me that ?
No ! I came here to tell you something else . I came here to tell you I still love you .
What <unk> did <unk> ? !
I still love you . And I know I probably shouldn &apos;t even be here telling you this , I mean you &apos;re with Chandler a guy I really like , and if you say he &apos;s straight I &apos;ll believe you ! After seeing ya the other night I knew if I didn &apos;t tell ya I &apos;d <unk> it for the rest of my life . <unk> you go was the stupidest thing I ever did .
Y &apos;know you &apos;re really not supposed to be back here !
Well yeah , I &apos;m sorry . I know this is the wrong time and the wrong place but I had to tell ya ! I wanna spend my life with you . I wanna marry you . I wanna have kids with you .
Oh God ... Why don &apos;t they put chairs back here ? !
I know this is crazy but am I too late ?
What the ... Yes you &apos;re too late ! Where was all this three years ago ? !
Well I know I was an idiot ! And I tried to forget you , I really did ! Y &apos;know after we had lunch last year I spent six months in <unk> trying to get you out of my head !
What were you doing in <unk> ?
<unk> with blind kids .
Ohhh ! What are you doing to me ? ! Oh look , I-I ... I &apos;m sorry but umm , <unk> is not going to happen .
Okay that &apos;s fine , I &apos;ll walk away . And I &apos;ll never bother you again , but only if you tell me Chandler &apos;s willing to give you everything I am .
Well he is ! Yeah , I mean marriage is all he talks about ! My <unk> , in fact , I &apos;m the one that &apos;s making him wait !
You are ?
Yeah !
Why ?
Why ? Because of the government .
Isn &apos;t it incredible ? ! Monica and Chandler , gettin &apos; married .
I know , they &apos;re gonna be so happy together .
Ohh ... I mean two best friends falling in love , how often does that happen ?
Not that often !
No ! I &apos;m so happy for them !
Me too ! So happy for them !
I &apos;m so happy and not at all jealous .
Oh no ! No God , definitely not jealous !
I mean I &apos;m probably 98 % happy , maybe 2 % jealous . And I mean what &apos;s 2 % ? That &apos;s nothing .
Totally . I &apos;m like 90 / 10 .
Yeah me too .
Hey uh , have you guys scene Chandler ?
<unk> , but y &apos;know who did stop in here looking for ya , <unk> .
So that marriage stuff that you were saying yesterday , you don &apos;t really believe that do you ?
Sure I do . In fact , I think the whole concept of marriage is <unk> . I mean look at pigs . Let &apos;s take a second here and look at pigs . Okay pigs don &apos;t mate for life . I mean a pig can have like a hundred sexual partners in a lifetime , and that &apos;s just an <unk> pig not even a pig that &apos;s good at sports !
Yeah , but that &apos;s pigs not people !
If marriage worked , I &apos;d be all for it . But do you know what the divorce rate in this country is ? 97 % .
Wait a minute . Are you honestly telling me that-that you may never want to get married ?
Well , never say never but y &apos;know probably uh yeah , never .
Oh my God ! <unk> what are we even doing ? ! What is this ? !
Whoa ! Whoa ! Whoa ! What is all this pressure ? ! Is this some new kind of <unk> ? Why don &apos;t you put down your copy of &apos; The Rules &apos; huh <unk> ? !
Y &apos;know what ? ! I gotta go ! Ugh !
It &apos;s okay , I got a plan .
We &apos;re gonna find love !
Definitely !
Yeah , I &apos;m pretty confident about that . That &apos;s what makes it so easy for me to be 80 % happy for Monica and Chandler ! It would be nice to have a little guarantee though .
What do you mean ?
Well y &apos;know , some people make <unk> with a friend , like if neither of them are married by the time they &apos;re 40 , they marry each other .
You mean a backup ?
Exactly !
Yeah , yeah I got that .
You do ?
Hm-mmm .
Who ?
Joey .
Joey ? !
Yeah !
Are you serious ? !
Yeah , I locked him years ago !
Wh ... So ... If neither of you are married by the time you &apos;re 40 , you &apos;re gonna marry Joey .
Yep , we <unk> on it . Yeah but believe me that is not how he wanted to <unk> the deal .
Oh , seriously ?
Ohh , yeah . I think his exact words were ...
<unk> .
Well hey , it &apos;s just a backup .
Yeah .
Hey Monica !
Have you seen Rachel ? Or a mirror ?
This is for my boat , pretty cool huh ?
Yeah , it &apos;s great .
Whoa-whoa , what &apos;s the matter ? ! Talk to the captain !
I &apos;m just having one of those days where you realize you &apos;re in a <unk> relationship !
Chandler giving you a hard time huh ?
It &apos;s not like I want to get married tomorrow ! It &apos;s just that I-I &apos;d like to believe that I &apos;m in a relationship that &apos;s actually going somewhere , that I &apos;m not just wasting my time !
Well , you know Chandler .
No I don &apos;t know Chandler ! Not anymore ! It &apos;s like it &apos;s like something &apos;s changed .
Maybe you changed ?
I didn &apos;t change !
Maybe that &apos;s the problem .
What ? !
Chandler is a complex fellow , one who is unlikely to take a wife .
Is that some kind of boat talk ?
I don &apos;t know ! I haven &apos;t totally decided how to talk on my boat yet .
What does he think ? Does he think I &apos;m just gonna wait around for nothing ?
Monica face it , Chandler is against marriage . And-and always will be !
Well there &apos;s some people who do want to marry me .
There are ?
Yeah ! Richard !
<unk> said he wants to marry you ? ! And-and Chandler &apos;s tellin &apos; ya how much he hates marriage ? !
That &apos;s right .
Chandler loves marriage ! !
You just told me that he hates marriage ! That-that he &apos;s a-a complex fellow who &apos;s unlikely to take a wife ! That-that he &apos;s against marriage and always will be !
You got that from what I said ? !
When the <unk> period ended , the dinosaurs were gone .
What happened you guys ?
Rach !
Hey you !
Hey , come on in .
Oh thank you . Hey y &apos;know , I &apos;m so sorry to hear about you and Elizabeth .
Oh , thanks . Yeah , I really thought we &apos;d be able to make it work , but uh , I guess it just wasn &apos;t meant to be .
Yeah , love . It &apos;s a tricky business isn &apos;t it ?
I guess so .
So what do you say we make a <unk> ? If you and I are both single by the time we &apos;re 40 , we get married . I mean , we know each other , we like each other , and we &apos;ve-we &apos;ve already slept together so y &apos;know there &apos;ll be no <unk> there ! You know what I mean ? No like , &quot; What &apos;s that ? ! &quot;
Right . Ohh ! You-you want me to be your backup .
Exactly .
Ohh , yeah I already have one .
What ? Who ?
Phoebe .
Phoebe ? ! Wait <unk> she just , she said that Joey was her backup .
Ohh , I don &apos;t think so .
Ross ! I just had a conversation with her , and she said that she and Joey made a deal !
That &apos;s impossible ! I mean we have had a deal for years ! <unk> <unk> on it , although believe me she wanted to do a lot more than that .
Where the hell have you been ? !
I was making a coconut phone with the professor .
Richard told Monica he wants to marry her !
What ? !
Yeah ! Yeah , I &apos;ve been trying to find ya to tell to stop messing with her and maybe I would have if these damn boat shoes wouldn &apos;t keep flying off !
<unk> my God !
I know ! They suck ! !
He &apos;s not supposed to ask my girlfriend to marry him ! I &apos;m supposed to do that !
I know !
Well what ... Y &apos;know what I &apos;m gonna do ? I &apos;m gonna go over there ; I &apos;m gonna kick his ass ! Will you help me ? !
Look , Chandler I don &apos;t think us getting our <unk> kicked is a solution . Okay ? Just go and find Monica !
You &apos;re right .
Yeah !
Okay . I &apos;m gonna get the ring ! I &apos;m gonna get the ring ! I &apos;m gonna go find her and I &apos;m just going to propose !
Okay .
Okay great .
<unk> !
What ? !
Let me know about that coconut phone , it might great for the boat .
Hi .
Hi .
I don &apos;t know why I &apos;m here .
I didn &apos;t ask . You wanna come in ?
I don &apos;t know .
Oh , okay . Well , I &apos;ll just leave the door open and go sit on the couch .
Chandler is such an idiot !
<unk> ?
Yeah , I &apos;ll have a <unk> ...
... on the rocks with a <unk> ? I remember .
Still smoking cigars ?
Uh , no ! No ! That &apos;s ... art ! If it bothers you I can put my art out .
No that &apos;s , that &apos;s okay .
So Monica let me ask you a question . Y &apos;know , since we broke up do you ever , think about me ?
Uh yeah , I-I actually I thought about you a couple months ago .
Oh really ?
Yeah but it was because I-I had an eye exam and I don &apos;t like my new eye doctor .
Who is it ?
<unk> <unk> ?
Yeah he &apos;s no good . Do you ever think about me in a <unk> doctor way ?
No .
Ahh .
But getting over was the hardest thing that I &apos;ve ever had to do . And I never let myself think about you .
Phoebe ! You picked Joey and Ross ? ! You can not have two <unk> !
Of course I can ! It &apos;s just good sense to backup your backup ! Look , I &apos;ve already lost Chandler !
What ? !
Hey !
Hey !
Phoebe ! We &apos;re both your backup ? !
Phoebe , how could you do this to me ? !
I don <unk> I don &apos;t know what you &apos;re <unk> about now ? You were both aware of the situation !
No we weren &apos;t !
I was not !
Okay , this kind of back talk is not gonna fly when we &apos;re married !
Phoebe you can &apos;t have both of them ! You have to pick one !
Pick me ! !
No ! Pick me ! I don &apos;t want to end up an old maid !
All right well let &apos;s see , Ross is a good father , but Joey has a <unk> is hard !
This is crazy ! Hey look , I wanna switch to Rachel !
Ooh , I wanna switch to Rachel too !
No wait ! <unk> wait ! You guys ! Wait you guys ! Don &apos;t make any <unk> decisions , okay ? Just remember my promise , when we get married , three times a week .
Oh God , Phoebe !
I &apos;m talking about massages .
Oh .
Okay , y &apos;know what ? ! I know-I know how to settle this ! All right here , this is what we &apos;re gonna do ! I &apos;m gonna write Joey on one napkin and I &apos;m gonna right Ross on the other napkin and we are going to pick one ! And that person is going to be our backup ! Okay ?
Okay that &apos;s fair .
All right .
Good !

Yeah absolutely !
Yeah .

Excuse me ?
Oh ! Him .
Oh . Whew !
I missed this apartment ! Now , this is a grown-up &apos;s apartment ! Y &apos;know , I-I should be with a grown-up , do you know what I mean ? !
Yeah ! You &apos;re saying , you need to be with someone more mature . Maybe someone with , a license to practice medicine . Or a mustache .
Y &apos;know , let &apos;s face it , I &apos;m not a kid anymore ! I-I need to be with someone who-who wants the same things that I do ! I mean coming to my place of work and telling me that you love me , I want that ! <unk> about pig sex over lunch , I don &apos;t want that !
I think that &apos;s fair .
Fair ? Please don &apos;t even talk to me about fair ! Fair would &apos;ve been you wanting to marry me back then ! Or fair would &apos;ve been Chandler wanting to marry me now ! Believe me , nothing about this is fair ! Nothing ! Nothing ! Nothing ! Nothing ! Nothing ! Nothing ! Nothing ! Nothing ! Nothing ! Nothing !
It &apos;s okay ! Shh ! Hey . Hey . Shhhh .
Nothing . I don &apos;t <unk> . I don &apos;t know . Umm ...

Yeah , I understand . Take as much time as you want . Ten , even twenty minutes if you need it . I &apos;ll be here . Not smoking .
Chandler .

She &apos;s not here and please come in .

Okay , she was here , but she left .
Well where did she go ?
Well she said she had to think things over .
Oh my God , I can &apos;t believe this ! Y &apos;know , I thought ... I thought you were a good guy .
Oh , hey look nothing happened .
Nothing happened ? Nothing ? So you didn &apos;t tell my girlfriend that you love her ?
Well all right , one thing happened ?
Y &apos;know what ? I can &apos;t believe this ! Do you know what you did ? My girlfriend is out there thinking things over ! You made my girlfriend think ! !
Well I &apos;m sorry .
And what does she have to think about ? I love her !
Well , apparently I &apos;m willing to offer her things that you are not .
But I am willing to offer her all those things . This was just a plan , y &apos;know ? A way to throw her off course so that when I offered her all these things , she &apos;d be surprised !
Well if it helps , it worked very well .
It was working until you showed up , you big tree ! I mean , this isn &apos;t fair . You had your chance with her ! You had your chance and you blew it ! And this is my chance and I am not going to blow it because we are meant for each other ! And this is all just been one stupid mistake ! I was gonna propose tonight .
You were gonna propose ?
Yeah I even got a ring . Did you get a ring ?
No I don &apos;t have a ring ! You go get her Chandler . And can I give you a piece of advice ? If you do get her , don &apos;t let her go . Trust me .
Y &apos;know Richard ... you are a good guy .
I know . I hate that !
Dude !
I can &apos;t talk to you now , I gotta find Monica !
She &apos;s gone .
What ?
She &apos;s gone . She had a bag and she left .
What are you talking about ?
She was all crying . She-she said you guys want different things , and that and that she needed time to think .
Well why didn &apos;t you stop her ? ! Why didn &apos;t you just tell her it was a plan ? !
I-I did ! I told her everything , Chandler ! But she wouldn &apos;t believe me .
Well where ... Where did she go ?
To her parent &apos;s I think and she said you shouldn &apos;t call her . But if I were you I would .
I can &apos;t believe I ruined this .
I am so sorry man .
You wanted it to be a surprise .
Oh my God .
Chandler ... In all my life ... I never thought I would be so lucky . As to ... fall in love with my best ... my best ... There &apos;s a reason why girls don &apos;t do this !
Okay ! Okay ! Okay ! Oh God , I thought ... Wait a minute , I-I can do this . I thought that it <unk> what I said or where I said it . Then I realized the only thing that matters is that you , you make me <unk> than I ever thought I could be . And if you &apos;ll let me , I will spend the rest of my life trying to make you feel the same way . Monica , will you marry me ?
Yes .
I knew you were <unk> to take a wife !
Can we come it yet ? ! We &apos;re dying out here !
Come in ! Come in ! We &apos;re engaged ! ! !

What ? ! What are you talking about ?
What are you talking about ?
Yes , I ... I am with child . And I didn &apos;t want to say anything because it &apos;s your day ; I didn &apos;t want to steal your thunder .
Wait a minute ! So you told people I was pregnant ? ! Does this look like a conversation that I want to remember ? !
Who &apos;s the father ?
Yeah !
I can &apos;t say .
Why ? !
Why not ?
I can &apos;t say because he &apos;s famous .
Oh my God , who is it ? !
Phoebe , come on , you have to tell us .
Okay , okay . It &apos;s James Brolin . James Brolin is the father of my baby .
As in Barbara <unk> &apos;s husband James Brolin ?

Why don &apos;t we have Monica step away and we &apos;ll get Chandler and the bridemaids .
How about just the bridemaids ?
Y &apos;know I am the groom right ? I was told it was kinda big deal .
It is .
For you .
Oh my God !

I don &apos;t know ! Maybe they have <unk> .
Well I-I talked to and uh , she &apos;s definitely going to have this baby . Y &apos;know , she said she was gonna raise it on her own .
Well , maybe that &apos;s , maybe that &apos;s really brave .

Maybe she hasn &apos;t really thought it through that well .
Well , there &apos;s a lot to think about . I mean , how is she , how is she going to handle this <unk> ? How is she going to <unk> work ? Does she realize she &apos;s not going to have a date again for the next <unk> years ?

Calm down . Maybe you &apos;re not pregnant .

When I got pregnant with the triplets , I took that test like three times just to make sure .
Yes ! Maybe it &apos;s a <unk> positive . Are you sure you peed on the stick right ?
How many ways are there to do that ?
I &apos;m-I &apos;m just saying , don &apos;t freak out until you &apos;re a hundred percent sure .

Oh-oh yeah , you-you came up to me and asked if I could do you a favor , and my Uncle Murray came up to you and handed you a check . And then you said , &quot; Why do they call it a check ? Why not a <unk> ? &quot; Yeah , then you did that .

Or this one !
Hi .
Hey , how are you feelin &apos; ? Any morning sickness ?

Don &apos;t worry I promise that you will only have to be pregnant for a few more hours , &apos; cause I &apos;m going to tell the father today .
Ooh , is it someone in this building ? Is it that tall guy from the first floor ?
Ew ! No !

Believe me I &apos;m trying .
Wow . Y &apos;know it is so weird . I mean , you &apos;re gonna tell this guy today and he has no idea what &apos;s gonna happen .

I didn &apos;t think you could keep it a secret .
What ? ! I am an excellent secret keeper . I have kept all of our secrets .
What secrets ?
Oh no-no Joey , I am not going to tell you because I am an excellent secret keeper .
You &apos;ll tell me later ?
You already know .

Y &apos;know , Monica and Chandler are married . Ross and Rachel are having a baby . Maybe you and I should do something .
All in good time my love . All in good time . Oh shoot ! I left my guitar in their apartment . Well you can let me in later .
I don &apos;t have a key , they took mine to give to you .
What ? ! They took mine to give to you !
Why would they take away our keys ?
Maybe they don &apos;t trust us .
No that &apos;s not it . They let me keep my key the last time they were out of town .
You mean the time you broke the ketchup bottle and cleaned it up with Monica &apos;s guest towels ?
Hey , I washed those !
No you didn &apos;t .
Yeah that didn &apos;t sound like me .
Well , what am I gonna do ? I really need my guitar !

Oh no .
What ?
I think I might know what this is about .
Really ?

And ?
Wow ! I thought you would be a little more <unk> .
Oh sorry . And ? !
Well , we-we said we &apos;d just do it that one time but , but now I think she may wanna start things up again .
Yeah , I don &apos;t think that &apos;s what it is .
Why ? What-what else could it be ?
Oh wow , I don &apos;t feel well .
I &apos;m telling you . I &apos;m telling you . That &apos;s what it is . No wonder she was looking at me all funny during the wedding . She didn &apos;t say anything to you ?
Maybe it &apos;s something you ate ?
Please , just-just , just go and talk to Rachel .
Yeah , I guess I should . Man , y &apos;know what I have to realize ? Maybe I &apos;m just not the type of guy women can have just one night with . Y &apos;know , they-they always seem to want a little bit more . I should remember that .

Drake , I &apos;ve discovered the reason for all your <unk> and memory loss .
What is it ?
Apparently your brain <unk> was not entirely successful . It seems your body is rejecting Jessica &apos;s brain .
Is it serious ?
Not if we <unk> tissue from the original host body , <unk> <unk> , and introduce them into your system , which could stop it from rejecting the brain .
Well that sounds simple enough , let &apos;s just do that .
We would , but when we went to <unk> Jessica &apos;s body , it was gone .

Although I do know that your uh , your favorite ice cream <unk> is butter <unk> . And uh , and that your-your dog &apos;s name is <unk> . Well look at that , I &apos;m just <unk> your arm .
Here we go ! Here we go !

Ooh Monica !
Hi !
Oh my God ! I had the best time with Tim last night . He is so sweet ! Oh , I can &apos;t wait to get <unk> him .
I ... I have to fire him .
But why ? !
Because he &apos;s terrible ! Okay , he &apos;s slow , he burns things , last night he lit my pastry chef on fire !
Well maybe he was just nervous , y &apos;know you can be very <unk> . And besides I &apos;ve met your pastry chef and she can stand to be taken down a <unk> or two .
Well , now she has no <unk> , mission <unk> .
But Monica , he loves his job so much ! Can you just give him another chance ? Please ?
All right , but if-if he lights someone else on fire he is out of there !
That &apos;s fair ! Thank you so much . Thanks . Oops , it looks like when he got the pastry chef he got you a little bit too .
I paid to have this done .
Love it !
Hey !
Hi !
Oh you know uh Kash , really liked you the other day . He said he thought you were charming .
I thought I was a complete idiot .
Hey , I &apos;m with you . He even asked me if I thought you &apos;d go out with him .
Oh ! Oh , I think I &apos;m gonna throw up a little bit . What did you say ?
I said no .
What ? !
What ? I ... I just figured since you &apos;re pregnant you &apos;re not gonna be seeing people .
Okay Joey , first of all Kash Ford is not people . Second of all , what did he say when you told him I was pregnant ?
I didn &apos;t tell him . I didn &apos;t know if you were telling people . This is back when I thought Kash was still people .
Good-good , don &apos;t tell him . Don &apos;t tell him . Just have him call me okay ?
Rach look , I really don &apos;t think that &apos;s such a great ...
Okay , you go do it ! I &apos;ll come back to that set ! I &apos;ll meet more actors ! I &apos;ll meet &apos; em all !
Hey Bob .
Hey ! How &apos;s my pal Toby doing today ?
If I see him , I &apos;ll ask .
Toby !
Hey-hey ! Bing ? Was that Bob from six you were just talking too ?
Yeah !
Oh then you know each other .
We &apos;re on a <unk> name <unk> .
What do you think of adding him to our team ?
Bob ? Ooh , working here with us ? <unk> ? Yeah , I don &apos;t know if he has what it takes .
Really ? They love him down on six .
But this is eleven . It &apos;s almost twice as hard up here .
Okay , I hear you loud and clear . Bob will stay put .
I think it &apos;s best sir .
But we really do need to find someone up here . The work is starting to <unk> up . I &apos;ve got a <unk> of <unk> on my desk this high .
Y &apos;know what you should do , just toss &apos; em in the <unk> and claim you never got &apos; em .
That &apos;s a good one .
What does a guy have to do to be taken seriously around here ? !
Hey !
Hey . Okay , I gave him another chance , but Tim has got to go !
But ...
No ! No-no ! He is totally <unk> . I called the chef who <unk> him to me . He said , &quot; Ha-ha ! Gotcha ! &quot;
Okay . Okay , but you can &apos;t fire him today .
Why not ? !
Because I &apos;m dumping him today .
What ? ! You said he was sweet !
He is sweet . He &apos;s too sweet . He calls me all the time . &quot; So <unk> you get home from work okay ? &quot; &quot; Did-did you get out of the shower okay ? &quot;
Just don &apos;t pick up your phone .
Then he comes over ! &quot; I &apos;m so worried about you . &quot; Uck ! Be a man !
What ? So now I &apos;m not allowed to fire him ?
You can &apos;t fire him and dump him the same day , he &apos;ll kill himself .
Okay well then , I &apos;ll fire him today and you go out with him for another week .
Are you kidding ? ! Another week with that <unk> , I &apos;ll kill myself !
Okay well , then we &apos;ll both do it today and he &apos;ll just have to deal with it !
Okay . But the question is who &apos;s gonna go first . &apos; Cause whoever goes second is the bitch .
What do you mean ?
Come on ! The boss that <unk> a guy that &apos;s just been dumped , bitch ! And the woman who <unk> a guy that &apos;s just been fired , blond bitch !
I wanted to do this days ago so I think I should go first .
All right , that makes sense . Ugh . <unk> you I &apos;m going first !
Hey Toby , you got a sec ?

I just had a meeting , I was actually hoping to get <unk> up here , but I just found out its not gonna happen . Apparently somebody thinks I &apos;m not <unk> floor material . Say uh , who the hell is this Chandler ?
Hey , what do you think is a better excuse for why I &apos;m not drinking on this date tonight . &quot; Umm , I &apos;m a <unk> <unk> . I &apos;m a <unk> , &quot; or &quot; I got so hammered last night I &apos;m still a little drunk ? &quot;

I set her up with this actor on my show .

Joey , I &apos;m not worried about her ! I &apos;m worried about my baby ! Whoever she dates my baby dates ! Now-now where is this actor taking them ?
Hey ! I &apos;m an actor too ! I &apos;m not sure . I think they &apos;re taking the ferry out to some Italian place on Staten Island .
A ferry ? My baby is going on a ferry ? Do you have any idea how dangerous those are ? !
Are we talking about one of those big <unk> that carry <unk> that go like five <unk> an hour ?

I <unk> can &apos;t believe she &apos;s-she &apos;s dating ? !
Well Ross , what did you think she was gonna do ?
I don &apos;t know ! I guess I just can &apos;t believe any of this is happening .
What do you mean ?
It &apos;s just I always thought when I had another kid it would be different . Now I-I love Ben , but every time I have to drop him off at Carol and Susan &apos;s , it &apos;s <unk> breaks my heart a little . I mean I &apos;ve always had this picture of me and my next wife in bed on Sunday and , my kid comes running in and <unk> up onto the bed . And we all read the paper together . Y &apos;know ? Maybe fight over the science <unk> .
That &apos;s a nice picture . Maybe you can still have that !
No ! No I can &apos;t . I mean Rachel &apos;s out with some guy . My baby went with her . If anything that picture keeps moving further away .
Hey , can I ask you something ? In this , in this picture of you and your wife , is your wife Rachel ?
It used to be . Now she doesn &apos;t really have a face . <unk> &apos; body though .
Good call . Yeah . But , the face Ross , the face isn &apos;t Rachel .
No but ahh ! How much easier would it be if it were ?
I know , but I don &apos;t think that &apos;s what she wants .
No , it &apos;s not what I want either . I mean I-I can &apos;t force myself to fall in love with her again now .
That &apos;s okay Ross maybe you need a new picture . Okay ? It &apos;s not gonna be what you thought , but no matter what there &apos;s gonna be a brand new little baby , your baby . Who cares what the picture looks like ?
Yeah .
Hey , I tell you what . Let &apos;s you and me go out and have some fun . Huh ? Whatever you want . Come on !

So <unk> Joey know you &apos;re moving ?
Well , I haven &apos;t discussed it with him yet , but I know he &apos;s gonna be relieved . Last week , he brought this girl over and I started talking to her about morning sickness and then I showed her pictures from my pregnancy book .
That &apos;s not really porn .
Not so much .
Hey , y &apos;know what and if you &apos;re looking for a place ? I just heard in the elevator this morning that a woman in my building died .
Oh my God ! Was she old ? Does she have a view ?
Well I don &apos;t know , but how-how great would that be huh ? You living in my building . I could help take care of the baby . I can come over whenever I want . With your <unk> .

My mother &apos;s still alive .
Oh , thank God !
It looked like we were gonna lose her this morning , but she &apos;s a tough old bird .

She stole my jeans !
What ?
I have been looking for them all week and she is wearing them !
So she stole your pants and then she came back and wore them in front of you ?
Don &apos;t you see ? It &apos;s the perfect crime !
She must &apos;ve been planning this for years !
I will prove it to you ! Okay ? About a week ago I was wearing those jeans and I dropped a pen in my lap and it left an ink stain on the crotch . Now when she comes back I will find it and show you that stain !
Honey , isn &apos;t it possible that the company that sold the jeans made more than just the one pair ?
I guess .
So , shouldn &apos;t we go give her the benefit of the doubt before we go ... <unk> around her crotch ?
Fine . I &apos;m just glad I didn &apos;t give her my secret ingredient .
Out of curiosity , what is your secret ingredient ?
Yeah !
Hi !
Come in , I &apos;m so glad you &apos;re here .
Yeah , me too . Not in the <unk> angry way you are though .
Sorry , I just saw Ursula . I had to give the engagement ring back .
Oh .
Just seeing her brought it all back . All the lies , the way she used me . I just ... I got so angry just looking at her ...... face .
Yeah . Yeah .
I &apos;m sorry . I just ... when I look at you I see her . When I see her I get a little bit angry .
Maybe this is too weird .
No wait ! There &apos;s only a problem when I look at you . Oh I got it ! I got it .
No don &apos;t tear out your eyes ! !
I was just , I was just gonna take out my <unk> .
Oh , yeah try that . So , is that better ?
Not really . You ... you &apos;re <unk> , but you still look like Ursula . You &apos;re <unk> . Okay wait . Maybe ... If <unk> I just don &apos;t look at you for a while . See ? It ... it works . I &apos;m not , I &apos;m not angry at all anymore ! This is a great date !
Look Eric , turn around . Look , I like you , but it shouldn &apos;t be this hard . Y &apos;know ? This is our first date y &apos;know ? First dates are supposed to be about excitement and <unk> and &apos; Ooh , he just touched my hand , did he mean to touch my hand ? &apos; and y &apos;know first kisses and ...... second kisses .

To tape the game ? You do this every time Ross , you &apos;re not gonna be on TV !
No-no , I-I have to see if this apartment became available .
Oh , you &apos;re switching apartments ?
It &apos;s not for me , it &apos;s for Rachel .
But Rachel has an apartment .
Yeah , but when the baby comes she &apos;s gonna want to move .
She is ?
Yeah , you didn &apos;t expect her to live there with a baby did you ?
I guess I didn &apos;t really think about it .
Ezel ! Hey Gunther ! You &apos;re an <unk> !

Damnit !
Nice jeans !
Oh thanks ! I like your top .

How was the game ?
Oh , okay . I ... I ate way too much .
Oh .
Ooh . So umm , I was talkin &apos; to Ross and he said you were looking for a new place .
Oh yeah ! <unk> across the street if certain Dutch people would just let go .
I was kinda hoping you &apos;d stay .
Oh but Joey , I have to go . There &apos;s no room for a baby here .
No room ? It &apos;s a baby . It &apos;s like this big . Y &apos;know , I mean you-you could you could put it over here . <unk> we could put it right here . Aw , it &apos;s cute , right ? Or-or we could put it over here . You wouldn &apos;t even notice it . Where &apos;s the baby ?
Honey , it &apos;s not just a matter of where you put it . I mean a baby changes everything . They cry all the time . I mean imagine bringing home some girl and trying to score when there &apos;s a screaming baby around .
I could use a challenge ! It &apos;s getting pretty easy .
Honey , it &apos;s so sweet that you want me to stay , but I-I can &apos;t do that to you . I mean it would <unk> your entire life .
I love living with you so much . I just wish things didn &apos;t have to change .
I know .
Y &apos;know I blame Ross for this .
I do too a little bit .
I &apos;m gonna miss you , you &apos;re the <unk> roommate I ever had .
Ooh , oh no ! I have to go ! I have a massage appointment .
Oh no , stay here we &apos;ll keep doing this . I &apos;ll pay you .
No , I got in trouble for that before . I &apos;ll see you later .
Absolutely . I love the way you kiss .
Really ? That &apos;s the thing I &apos;m worse at ! You &apos;ll see .
Hi !
Hey ! Umm , I think Brenda needs a raise .
How come ?
Because I put my head between her legs .
To see her pants ?
They &apos;re my pants !
Are you sure ? Did you see the stain ?
No ! I was just getting into position and then everything went dark .
God ! She is not stealing from us ! Okay , will you let this go ?
Fine . She &apos;s wearing my bra !
Oh dear God !
My pink <unk> bra ! I recognize the <unk> !
And yet you don &apos;t recognize that you &apos;re crazy .
Here &apos;s the plan ! Okay ? I &apos;m going to leave you get a look at Brenda &apos;s bra !
Here &apos;s another plan ... No !
I would do it but she thinks I &apos;m attracted to her !
Why ?
Did you not hear where my head was ? Come on ! Come on we &apos;re a team ! We &apos;re in this together !
I fear a <unk> will see it the same way !
Do this for me ! Come on , I catch you looking at woman &apos;s breasts all the time !
You see that ?
Do you see this ?
All right . Yes . Okay . I get your point . But if it &apos;s not your bra will you just let the woman clean the apartment ? !
Yes ! Absolutely . Okay ? Look , you &apos;ll know it &apos;s mine because on the right cup , the <unk> part , there &apos;s a very <unk> rip .
You need new clothes .
Hi . How is she ?
It &apos;s not looking good .
Oh . Oh . Well I uh , I brought her some <unk> .
That &apos;s so sweet . Would you like to come in and say good-bye ? I &apos;m sure it would mean a lot to her .
Oh I don &apos;t know that it would .
Well , her memory is pretty much gone .
All right then .
Hey !
Welcome back !
Hey ! Can we pick up where we left off ?
I don &apos;t know , I &apos;m still pretty tired out from this afternoon .
Why ?

You-you ... you had sex with Ursula ? !
Uh , a little bit . <unk> walked in and I thought she was you and I kissed her and ...
You didn &apos;t notice she was wearing different clothes ? !
Well I was just so excited to see you .
Oh . Ew ! Ew ! Ew ! Ugh ! Y &apos;know what ? This is too weird .
No-no it &apos;s not ! I don &apos;t want to lose you ! It &apos;s-it &apos;s like I was saying to Ursula when I was making love to her and I thought she was <unk> it is too weird .

I totally understand . Can I just see your bra ?
Hi !
Where did you get those jeans ? !

No I didn &apos;t !
All right , I took them . But I figured it would be okay because you got a big ink stain on the crotch .
Oh no ! Did you take my bra too ? !
What bra ?
The pink one with the flowers ? !
You mean the one that you &apos;re wearing ?
I quit !
Sounds about right .
What is this ?
Hey ! Uh , this is just to give you an idea . Okay well , we can put <unk> here , so that the baby has privacy , and-and-and maybe a <unk> over the crib . And <unk> look ! Here &apos;s a baby <unk> , which until the baby comes we can use as <unk> . Huh ?
You &apos;re so sweet . Oh my God ! And you gave the baby <unk> !
<unk> .... That-that-that &apos;s really just to show where the baby would go . Y &apos;know why don &apos;t I hold on to him so that there &apos;s no <unk> ?
But Joey the baby is going to be crying , it &apos;s going to be loud .
I &apos;m loud !
It &apos;s gonna be up all night !
I &apos;m up all night !
It &apos;s gonna <unk> !
Hello !
What about all the women you want to bring home ?
Look , if I &apos;m bringing home a woman who can &apos;t stand being around a baby , then maybe I don &apos;t want to be with that woman ! Or maybe we &apos;ll just do it in the bathroom of the club !
Joey , are you sure ?
Yeah ! All <unk> , I know sometimes it &apos;ll be hard , okay ? But , it &apos;ll also be really ... really great . Please Rachel ! I-I-I really want you to stay .

Could be . I mean technically she did strip , we just , we just missed it . Ma &apos;am , are you also a stripper ?
Uh , no . But I could pretend to strip , but that &apos;s gonna cost extra . Okay , here &apos;s the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ...
Maybe Monica &apos;s playing a joke on ya . Y &apos;know ? Getting her own husband a hooker , that &apos;s pretty funny .
That is funny , maybe for my birthday she &apos;ll <unk> someone .
I bet Ross was in on it too . I mean he was <unk> busy .
Do you mind if I smoke in here ?
Oh actually , I &apos;d rather you ... Yeah , go ahead . We &apos;re gonna have to burn that room down anyway .
How could you have kept all of this from me ?
I was going to tell you , but ...

Hey ! I did not dump Rachel ! <unk> are we still together . Can I just ... Why don &apos;t we just let the machine get that ?

Is that , is that what they call strippers sometimes ?
When they &apos;re <unk> .
Oh my God Stu ! I-I can &apos;t believe you did this ! Now are you absolutely sure she &apos;s a hooker ?
Either that or she &apos;s just the best , most expensive date I ever had .
Maybe she meant to get you a hooker .
Why would she do that ?
Maybe she wants you to learn something . Huh ? Now is there anything you &apos;re really bad at y &apos;know , sexually ?
This is the worst bachelor party ever !
What &apos;s taking you boys so long ?
In a minute !
In a minute ? What &apos;s gonna happen in a minute ? !

You do it !
You do it !

Okay . Um ... <unk> , yes Ross and I used to date . And yes we are gonna have a baby . But we are definitely not getting back together .
How can I be sure on that ?
Oh we <unk> drove each other crazy !
Yeah .
I mean he was <unk> , he was jealous , he could never just let the little things go !
Trying to date this woman .
Right ! But , none of that compared to how kind and-and how <unk> and <unk> he is .
Probably shouldn &apos;t touch me .
Y &apos;know , I-I-I just ... I don &apos;t want to get in the middle of something so complicated .
I know , I get it , but Mona , what relationship is not complicated ? I mean we all have our baggage ! You must too ! Why else would you still be single ? I am so gonna leave right now .
Should I leave this open for you too ?
I &apos;m not sure yet . Why didn &apos;t you just tell me about all this ?
Because what &apos;s going on with Rachel has nothing to do with how I feel about you .
Yeah ? Well you still shoulda told me .
I know and I was going to , but I thought it was better that you heard it from Rachel &apos;s father . Look I ... I made a mistake , but it &apos;s only because I really , really like you . Really !
Okay , I guess you can ... close the door now .
Forgot my purse ! Oh , you guys made up . He &apos;s a good kisser isn &apos;t he ? I &apos;m going !
I swear I didn &apos;t know she was a hooker ! I mean <unk> you let her smoke in here ?
Her ass print is still on your grandmother &apos;s <unk> , do you really want to talk about smoking ?
Y &apos;know what ? I &apos;m gonna make this up to you . I promised you a stripper , and you &apos;re gonna get a stripper .
Monica ! Wait !

Ooh , these tennis shoes are so tight . I think I &apos;ll take them off .
Could you not <unk> ?
Gotcha <unk> .

Wow , you told your dad the truth .
About an hour ago .
Wanna go see a movie ?
Yes ! Bye daddy .
... there &apos;s gonna be a wedding ! That &apos;s unacceptable Rachel ! What the hell does love have to do with it anyway ? ! There are more important things in a marriage other than love ! ... constantly thinking about things ! You have to think about the <unk> of your decision .
Hey ! I do too think about the <unk> of my decisions ! What gives you the right to ... Go to hell ! Stupid guy on my phone .
Hey Rach listen , did you know that during pregnancy your fingers <unk> up to twice their size and never go back .
Oh my ... God ! Let me see that !
You fall for it every time !
Hey !
Hi !
I brought you my old maternity clothes !
Oh Pheebs that &apos;s so <unk> , those are so cute !

Oh good you &apos;re all here . Thanksgiving tomorrow , four o &apos;clock . Oh , guess who I invited . Remember that guy Will <unk> from high school ?
No .
He was in Ross &apos;s class ... <unk> band ... kinda <unk> ? Well , really <unk> . I mean I was his thin friend .
Wow ! I don &apos;t remember him . Honey , are you sure you &apos;re not talking about your <unk> boyfriend .
No that was <unk> ! Wow ! I haven &apos;t thought about him in a long time ... Anyway , umm Will &apos;s , Will &apos;s here on business and he didn &apos;t have a place to go so I invited him here .
Oh that &apos;s nice .
Oh , and by the way , he &apos;s lost a bunch of weight . I mean he looks <unk> ! Okay , I mean really , really gorgeous ! I still love Chandler .
I just want you to say it once in a while .
All right okay , just so you know , I &apos;m not gonna make a turkey this year .

Phoebe !
Turkey &apos;s are beautiful , intelligent animals !
No they &apos;re not ! They &apos;re ugly and stupid and delicious !
All right ! Okay , it &apos;s just Phoebe . Will &apos;s still on a <unk> , Chandler doesn &apos;t eat Thanksgiving food , and Rachel &apos;s having her <unk> to <unk> .
She is ?
Remember I had to leave the room the other day when you had that <unk> chicken ?
Yeah . But I thought that was because I put the whole thing on my hand and made it walk across the table .
Anyway , it just doesn &apos;t seem worth it to make a whole turkey for just three people . Okay ? It &apos;s a lot of work .
But you gotta have turkey on Thanksgiving ! I mean , Thanksgiving with no turkey is like-like <unk> of July with no apple pie ! Or Friday with no two pizzas !
All right fine ! If it means that much to you ! But <unk> &apos;s gonna be a ton left over .
No there won &apos;t ! I promise I will finish that turkey !
All right , you &apos;re telling me you can eat an entire turkey in just one sitting ?
That &apos;s right ! &apos; Cause I &apos;m a Tribbiani ! And this is what we do ! I mean we may not be great <unk> or world <unk> , we don &apos;t read a lot or run very fast , but damnit ! We can eat !
Hey , isn &apos;t weird to think about how next year at this time they &apos;ll be a little baby at the table ? Rachel &apos;s ! But good to know where you &apos;re at !
Hey !
Hey !
Happy Thanksgiving !
You too !

Oh Will . But you-you &apos;ve worked so hard ...

Okay .
Uh Will umm , I just want to say that I &apos;m real sorry for whatever I-I did to you in high school ...
Oh , it wasn &apos;t just me . We had a club !
You had a club ? !
That &apos;s right , The I Hate Rachel Green Club !
Whoa ! My God ! So what , you all just joined together to hate me ? ! Who else was in this club ?
Me and Ross .
No need to point , she knows who Ross is .
So you were in an I Hate Rachel club ?
Yes he was .
No . No .
So who else was in this club ?
Uh actually , <unk> was also that exchange student from <unk> but I-I don &apos;t think he-he knew what it was .
So Ross , we went out for two years , and you never told me you were in an I Hate Rachel club .
You went out with her ? ! We had a <unk> !
That was in high school ! It &apos;s not like it was <unk> forever .
Then why did it have the word <unk> in it ?
Okay Monica , did you know about this ? !
I swear I didn &apos;t . Hey ! Is that why you guys used to go up to your bedroom and lock the door ?
Yeah .
Hmm , a little relieved , I gotta say .
Look Rach I-I &apos;m sorry , okay ? I ... I was a stupid kid , okay ? The only reason I joined ...
<unk> !
... <unk> . <unk> the club was because I was <unk> in love with you . Obviously I didn &apos;t handle it very well . But if you think about it the I Hate Rachel Club was really the I Love Rachel Club .
Uh , except that it was really the I Hate Rachel Club .
Okay . So what ? You guys would just like get together and like just say mean things about me ?
Well , we did a little more than that .
No-no ! No-no . No-no .
What ? ! What else did you do ?
We started a rumor .
What rumor ?
Oh , come on Will ! Just take off your shirt and tell us !
Ross !
It was no big deal . We-we ... said that the rumor was ... that umm ... you had both ... male and female <unk> parts .
What ? !
That &apos;s right ! We said your parents flipped a <unk> , decided to raise you as a girl , but you still had a hint of a penis .
Oh my God !
You started that ? !
What ? ! You heard that ? !
Everyone at our school heard it !
Everybody at my school heard it ! You were the <unk> cheerleader from Long Island ? !
Oh no ! ! ! ! Oh my God ! ! This is all making so much sense to me now ! This is why Adam <unk> wouldn &apos;t go out with me ! This is why <unk> <unk> would just stay in this <unk> !
Actually , <unk> <unk> is gay now . So-so that one &apos;s not really our fault .
Monica , how come you never told me this ? !
I thought it might be true . And I was afraid that you were gonna cry and then show it to me .
Joey stop staring ! There &apos;s nothing there ! It &apos;s not true !
I &apos;m afraid I &apos;m gonna need proof .
Oh !
You are my <unk> .
Joey , you don &apos;t have to finish that .
Oh yes I do . Otherwise what &apos;s next ? Today I &apos;m just a guy who can &apos;t finish a turkey , but tomorrow I &apos;m the guy who eats half a <unk> , wraps up the rest , and puts in the fridge ? No ! No , I just ... I just-I gotta change my pants . <unk> have no give .
Okay ! Okay ! Listen to what <unk> McMahon wrote in my yearbook <unk> year , &quot; Dear Rach , you &apos;re such a good person . &quot; Not girl ! <unk> !
Rach , I think you &apos;re reading a little too much into it .
&quot; Dear Rach , you &apos;re a great person . Sorry about your <unk> . &quot;
Look , what do you want me to do ? Do you want me to call everyone in the entire school and tell them it wasn &apos;t true ? !
Yes !
Could you also tell them I &apos;m <unk> now ?
Oh ! Me too !
Well look-look I &apos;m not calling anybody ! Okay ? It was like a million years ago !
I don &apos;t care how long ago it was ! You told people that I was half and half ! Y &apos;know what ? I just want to point out I never did anything to hurt you in high school .
That &apos;s not totally true .
What ?
What ?
Well you-you did start that rumor about Ross making out with Mrs. Altman , our <unk> <unk> .
How did you know that ? ! ! ! !
It &apos;s true ? ! !
No .
Yes it is ! I saw you guys going at it behind the card catalog !
Mrs. Altman ? She also made out with <unk> <unk> the night before he went back to <unk> .
I &apos;m sorry . When you were in high school you made out with a <unk> woman ?
Hey ! She didn &apos;t look 50 !
Did she look <unk> ?
Ohh , there &apos;s a picture of her in the yearbook actually .
Oh ! Wow !
She didn &apos;t <unk> well !
Well , she probably wasn &apos;t familiar with the <unk> having spent most of her life sitting for oil <unk> !
So how did this happen ? Did she , did she <unk> you to an early bird dinner ?
I was working late in the library one afternoon . It was just the two of us . She needed some help with her word <unk> . And one thing <unk> to another . If you must know , <unk> was very <unk> and <unk> . May she rest in peace ...
Didn &apos;t she walk with a <unk> ?
Only when it was <unk> ! ! I can &apos;t believe you-you told people about this ? ! Everybody knew ? ! Y &apos;know what ? I &apos;m back in the club !
Yeah !
I wanna join !
<unk> ! !
I &apos;m sorry . I &apos;m sorry . I never got to be in a club . I-I didn &apos;t go to high school , but three of us would meet behind a <unk> to learn French . <unk> .
All right , y <unk> ! You guys have your stupid little club , but I would just like to say is what you did to me is way worse than what I did to you ! You gave me a <unk> !
All right , listen you &apos;re just being silly . Rachel , even with that rumor you were one of the most popular girls in school and everyone wanted to be like you . One girl wanted to be like you so much she <unk> her pants with a <unk> Roll !
Wow ...
And Ross , if it weren &apos;t for Rachel &apos;s rumor I mean no one in high school would even know who you were . She put you on the <unk> !
As a <unk> of the <unk> .
Hey ! Mrs. Altman was the kind of woman you could tell she used to be pretty .
The eyes ... did still <unk> .
Hey guys this stuff is just so way in the past . You-you &apos;ve been through so much since then . And right now you &apos;ve got so much more important stuff going on in your life . Can &apos;t you just let this go ?
She &apos;s right .
Yeah . I mean we are having a baby together .
Hold on ! You got her pregnant ?
Yeah .
Are ya getting married ?
Nope .
So you knocked her up but you &apos;re not gonna marry her . Dude ! Anybody ?

Oh no ! Why not ?
Well it turns out that Ben and Sting &apos;s son do not get along .
How come ? !
Apparently , Sting &apos;s son made fun of the fact that Ben &apos;s moms are <unk> .

I-I don &apos;t-I don &apos;t think that I &apos;m gonna wear the boots tonight .
Why not ?
Well y &apos;know , I &apos;m just-I &apos;m just worried that bosses will see them and think they pay you too much money . Or ! Or your assistant will see them and-and want a raise !
Do you think I work at some kind of <unk> <unk> company ?
Anyway , I picked up this outfit that I want to wear and the , and the boots don &apos;t really go with it .
You said that you paid all that money because those boots go with <unk> , dresses , and pants !

Right . Are you looking for Jack &apos;s parents to discuss the problems he &apos;s having with Ben ? Yeah . Because I really do think the parents should sit down and have a conversation .
Yeah ! Let &apos;s do that ! ! That-that sounds good . We should sit down and talk , just me , my lover Carol , and the <unk> . Umm , how-how will I get in touch with them ?
Oh , their number is on the contact sheet .
Uh-huh . Uh-huh . Umm , could-could I get a copy of that ? &apos; Cause Carol threw it out , she lost ours . She &apos;s such a <unk> , but man what a hot piece of ass .

Umm , I &apos;m sorry . Won <unk> &apos;t Jack &apos;s father be <unk> us ?
Oh I &apos;m sorry , Jack &apos;s father is not available .
Uh-hmm . Okay . Well then , could we <unk> ? For say , Friday night perhaps at 8 o &apos;clock ?
Oh no , I know that wouldn &apos;t work . My husband &apos;s in concert .
<unk> . Yeah . That does put us in ... quite a pickle . Because you see I &apos;m very busy before and after the concert , and he &apos;s obviously busy during .
So , I guess you and I should talk about Jack and Ben right now .
Unless ! Unless umm , okay I-I would be willing to go to the concert , umm , all the while thinking about the children of course .
Are you here for tickets ?
Oh , thank you . Four would be great .
I &apos;m not giving concert tickets to someone who &apos;d use their son like this !
Oh good ! Then you &apos;re in luck ! Ben &apos;s not my son !
Look , I &apos;ve just <unk> a button , <unk> a silent alarm . Any minute now , the police will be here !
The <unk> ? Here ? A <unk> ? !
Okay , ten blocks down . Five to go .
Oh wait ! Stop ! Stop ! Stop !
Oh I &apos;m sorry ! Do you need a break ?
My boots in tan ! Hey ! Can you get a little closer so I can see the price ?
I can see it from right here . It &apos;ll cost you one husband .
Okay , I &apos;m sorry . I think I can walk the rest of the way now . Just-just give me my boots .
I don &apos;t have your boots .
Well I don &apos;t have them either . Where are they ?
Well , why don &apos;t you check in one of my <unk> while I <unk> on a <unk> of <unk> !
Okay . God well , we gotta go back and get them !

Y &apos;know what ? You can say goodbye to the tan ones .
Okay . All right .
Okay .
Bye <unk> ! Half off ? !
Joey , just because they &apos;re not getting married doesn &apos;t mean this is going to be a disaster . Maybe they have a plan !
Oh ? Oh ! Okay ! Okay ! Let &apos;s hear their plan ! Now , what &apos;s the future look like for Dina and Bobby ?
Well ... I really have high hopes for my band .
You were right . He is funny .
Hey , now wait a minute ! I get when you told people at first that you wanted to be an actor they laughed at you ! Now come on Bobby , why don &apos;t you tell us a little bit about your band ?
Well it &apos;s just me and my pal <unk> , the band &apos;s name is <unk> <unk> .
Really ?
Dina , if you &apos;re having a baby you should be married ! Even if it is to Bobby ! Dude , that &apos;s not a compliment !
No Joey ! I knew you wouldn &apos;t be supportive !
So <unk> ! What are you gonna do ? You &apos;re gonna have the baby and-and raise it by yourself ... without a husband ? ! You can &apos;t be a single mother alone ! You &apos;re gonna ruin your life !
Oh excuse me ! Am I <unk> my life ?
No ! No ! No ! It &apos;s different for you . You &apos;re so strong and together . You &apos;re not some dumb kid who doesn &apos;t know what she &apos;s doing .
Excuse me ?
One pregnant woman at a time , please ! I just want you to be okay .
So <unk> her to marry Bobby is gonna make that happen ?
Maybe ! Well ! Well ... so-so uh , what kind of music does <unk> <unk> forget it ! I can &apos;t !
Joey , I am scared to death about this . But I really think I can do it , I &apos;m just gonna need some help . And Bobby &apos;s gonna be here the whole time .
You bet I am ! And to answer your earlier question , we &apos;re <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Look , Rachel &apos;s told me how much easier you &apos;ve made all this on her . Why can &apos;t you do that for me ?
Because ! &apos; Cause ... &apos; Cause you &apos;re my baby sister !
And you &apos;re my big brother ! I mean , you &apos;re my favorite guy in the whole world . I &apos;m not even scared to tell mom and dad . I was scared of telling you .
Well I &apos;d be scared of them , but all right .
Joey , I can &apos;t stand the thought of having this baby with you mad at me . I want him to have his uncle . Is my baby gonna have his Uncle Joey ?
Of course he &apos;s gonna have his Uncle Joey !
We &apos;re gonna be all right . I mean , even if we &apos;re not married this baby is gonna be so loved . Not just by us .
That &apos;s right ! By his uncle too !
And by you .
Okay Bobby , why don &apos;t we just come over here and let them have a little moment .

Yeah ?
Look at that guy by the window , wow !
He &apos;s awfully short and I think he &apos;s talking to himself . And to be completely honest , he &apos;s not that good in bed .
Oh , what is wrong with me lately ? I mean it &apos;s like every guy I <unk> mean look here . Look at that guy for example , I mean normally that &apos;s not someone I would-would be attracted to , but right now , with the way I &apos;m feeling , all I want to do is rip off his <unk> and fanny pack .
Wait a second ! This is about the fourth month of your pregnancy , right ?
Yeah .
This is completely normal , around the fourth month your hormones start going crazy .
Really ? ! So this has happened to you ?
Oh absolutely yeah ! Oh and keep in mind , now , I was carrying triplets so in , y &apos;know , medical terms I <unk> was <unk> as <unk> .

You and Mona are doing a holiday card together ?
Yeah , we &apos;re not just doing a card ! Y &apos;know , she-she also wants to have the conversation about where the relationship is going .
Ugh ! Women !
I know ! I know ! Why do you guys need to have this conversation ? ! Huh ? I mean no <unk> man would ask a woman , &quot; So , where is this going ? &quot;
Uh Ross ? You asked me that .
Hey ! You were a closed book ! Okay ? I &apos;m not a mind reader ! Besides , I hate those <unk> . I &apos;m horrible at them . Really ! <unk> I need kind of a gesture . Y &apos;know , something that says we &apos;re moving forward without having to talk about it .
Like asking her to move in with you ?
<unk> than that .
Making her a mixed tape ?
Uh , bigger than that .
Give her a key to your apartment .
<unk> ! We were closer with the mixed tape .
All right . Have you said , &quot; I love you ? &quot; You could say , I love you .
Yeah I-I don &apos;t-I don &apos;t think I &apos;m quite there yet , but I could say I <unk> spending time with you .
No , we hate that .
That is a slap in the face .
Forget it . <unk> &apos;know what ? I &apos;ll just have the conversation . I &apos;ll just say I like things the way they are , and hope for the best . What do you think Rach ?
I think , if it was a little <unk> in here I could see your nipples through that sweater .
Bing ! We &apos;re all set for tonight , 8 o &apos;clock .
Oh uh , as it turns out , we can &apos;t do it . Monica has to work .

Okay .
I mean , there &apos;s no point in spending time with someone if-if it &apos;s just fun . It &apos;s gotta be , it &apos;s gotta be going somewhere right ? So where-where is it going ? Ah ! That &apos;s-that &apos;s the real question . And-and the answer is ... is it &apos;s going somewhere ... fun . Now I-I know what you &apos;re thinking , fun was fine for you like ten years ago y &apos;know , but you &apos;re-you &apos;re not getting any younger .

Chandler , why would you do that ?
Because it &apos;s awesome .
You think this is <unk> ?
Well y &apos;know , they only give you three letters , so after <unk> it is a bit of a challenge .
Hey wait a minute , this one isn &apos;t dirty .
It is when you put it together with that one .
Ah , well if you don &apos;t clear this off , you won &apos;t be getting one of those from me . But Ben &apos;s coming over here tomorrow to play this game , this can &apos;t be there .

Huh . Huh .
All right , now don &apos;t judge me . I normally wait until my date leaves , but you live here . I &apos;m ripping into this <unk> .
Ah ! Okay , well then you don &apos;t judge me . I &apos;m gonna suck on the <unk> from the brownie I had before .
So tell me , what are Joey Tribbiani &apos;s end of the night moves ?
Ah , well , if I want the girl to kiss me , first thing I do is make my lips look <unk> .
How do you do that ?
Now you can &apos;t tell anyone , but uh ... I put on <unk> lip <unk> .
Oh my God !
Yeah , like a <unk> to a flame , I &apos;m telling ya . Okay all right , so now you go .

More embarrassing than <unk> <unk> lip <unk> ? ! I didn &apos;t say <unk> before did I ? All right just-just tell me Rach , just tell me !
Okay . All right , stand up . Well , when we &apos;re at the door , I lightly press my lips against his , and then move into his body just for a second , and then I make this sound , &quot; Hmmm . &quot; Okay , I know it doesn &apos;t sound like anything , but I swear it works .

Yep ! Happy and healthy ! And cute !
And smart !

With an <unk> for science .
Are you two talking about the same baby ? Hey ! Have you started off thinking of names yet ?
Oh yeah ! I &apos;ve come up with a bunch of ideas !
Really ? Me too !
Me too !
Really ? !
Uh huh ! If it &apos;s a girl , Phoebe , and if it &apos;s a boy , Phoebo !
Maybe . But it wouldn &apos;t hurt to have a backup , you know ? Uh , <unk> , what were you thinking ?
Okay ! I was thinking if it &apos;s a girl , how about Sandrine ? It &apos;s French .
Huh . That &apos;s a really pretty name <unk> an <unk> <unk> .
Okay fine , what do you have ?
Well , OK , it &apos;s for a boy . Well , I know it &apos;s a little out there , but ... <unk> .
Wow , oh my God , our child will be <unk> to death in the <unk> .
Yeah , by Sandrine .
You &apos;re just saying that &apos; cause I said no to your name !
I &apos;m really , really not .
How-how about you each get five <unk> ?
All right .
All right .
That sounds fair .
Yeah ! I don &apos;t think you &apos;re going to need it though . Okay , check this out . If it &apos;s a girl , Rain .
Veto .

What is it ?
I drew you a bath !
Honey , I don &apos;t like baths ! Could you <unk> me a picture of us having sex on the balcony ?
Please , could you just try it for me ? Come on , I used all my best stuff ! I-I-I lit some candles . I put on some music . I used bath salts , plus bubble bath ! And got you this little plastic Navy ship . So it &apos;s a boy bath !
Well , this does <unk> it up a bit .
I swear , if you try it , you will love it !
All right , if I do this , can we at least discuss sex on the balcony ?
Absolutely .
Bet I know how that <unk> &apos;s going to go .
All right , this isn &apos;t so bad . I like the flower smell ! Which is okay , because I &apos;ve got my boat .
So ?
Oh my God .
I told you you were a bath person ! Hey , when you get out , maybe I can give you a <unk> !
I &apos;m going to need a bigger boat .
I don &apos;t think you had an open mind about the name Ruth . I mean , come on , little <unk> Geller , how-how cute is that ?
Oh , oh my God ! I can practically hear the <unk> tiles !
Okay ! All your <unk> look fine . Now , are you two interested in knowing the sex of the baby ?
Uh , no . No , we &apos;re not .
But you have it right there in that file ? You could tell us whether it &apos;s a boy or a girl ? <unk> or Sandrine ? Phoebe or Phoebo ?
That &apos;s right . But if you don &apos;t want to know ...
No , no , we want to wait , right ?
Right . Right .
Oh , I &apos;ll be right back . And , uh , I know it &apos;s really not my place , but please don &apos;t name your child Phoebo .
So , which of these babies do you think is the <unk> ?

Okay , but Ross just listen to me ...
No , no , no , no ! Don &apos;t tell me ! I don &apos;t want to know !
But I couldn &apos;t even if I wanted to , because I don &apos;t know ! I swear ; I didn &apos;t see anything , and I don &apos;t want to know ! It was just a <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> . Don &apos;t-don &apos;t you have any <unk> ?
Okay , a couple months late on the lecture , Ross .
Hello ?
I &apos;m in the bathroom , can you come in here ? I think there &apos;s something wrong .
You know what ? I-I think I &apos;ll wait out here .
I &apos;m in the bathtub .
Oh . What &apos;s wrong ?
I drew my own bath , but I did it wrong ! The water &apos;s <unk> . The salt didn &apos;t <unk> and is now ... lodged places . And the <unk> I used don &apos;t compliment each other . <unk> and <unk> !
What ?
The bath salts ! They &apos;re starting to <unk> ! It &apos;s different . It &apos;s interesting .
Okay , let &apos;s talk about something else .
Yeah ! Sure , sure . So , what was going on with you today ? Oh-oh-oh !
Well , I actually had the <unk> conversation with Joey . He was talking about rules and right and wrong and ...
I had the exact same conversation .
You did ? What was he talking about ?
I don &apos;t know ! Joey hasn &apos;t had this much trouble getting out words since we saw him in <unk> !
That was a long night .
All right , let &apos;s break this down . What exactly did he say to you ?
Okay , he was talking about rules .
Uh-huh .
Umm , and looking at people differently .
He didn &apos;t say anything about that to me .
What did he tell you ?
He was asking all these questions about you , me , and London . And , of course the <unk> that <unk> this all together , the rules .
Okay . So you , me and London . <unk> at people differently . Maybe he wants to do what you and I did in London with someone .
But what did he mean by rules ?
Wait a minute ! He stopped talking the minute Phoebe came in !
Because he was looking at her differently .
And Phoebe is his friend , so he thinks that would be breaking the rules !
My God ! He wants to do it with Phoebe in London !
You guys ?
Just a minute ! That &apos;s Mrs. Tribbiani !
You don &apos;t say anything .
Why would I say anything ? That two of our best friends could start the greatest love <unk> of their lives ! And they would have me to thank , and we could all start having babies ?
I &apos;m not going to let you say anything .
You just stay here !
Oh , God !
Oh , hey , Monica , I brought back your iron .
Oh , you had that ?
Uh-huh .
I thought I lost it . I got a new one , like , a month ago .
Oh , just as well , I broke this one .
What ?
Nothing .
Okay .
I mean , I-I , I really shouldn &apos;t say . I mean , I &apos;m really not supposed to .
Fine .
It &apos;s a <unk> !
Then it &apos;s really too bad that you can &apos;t tell me .
Somebody likes you !
Is it Chandler ?
No !
Well , then tell him to stop staring !
It &apos;s Joey !
Really ? ! Joey ? ! You don &apos;t say .
Is it something you &apos;d be interested in ?
I don &apos;t know , I don &apos;t know , I don &apos;t know . You know , I mean , on the one hand , Mother may I ? But y &apos;know on the other hand ... No . No , I can &apos;t . We &apos;re friends . No , oh , no . I don &apos;t want to <unk> what we have .
I guess that makes sense . So , you think you &apos;re going to talk to him ?
Sure , yeah . I mean , it &apos;s Joey . I don &apos;t want him to get hurt . Well , I must say , I am on fire ! First Chandler , now Joey !
Not Chandler , just Joey .
Sure .
Hey .
Hey .
You know what ? I &apos;ve been thinking about it . I &apos;m really coming around on the name Ruth . I think I would actually consider naming our child that .
Rach , I-I can &apos;t tell you how-how much that means to me ! Ohh ... Wait a minute . Wait a minute . You-you hated the name Ruth ! <unk> would you change your mind ? Unless , you know we &apos;re never going to have to use it . You did see the <unk> . You know it &apos;s a boy !
I didn &apos;t see anything ! I actually changed my mind about the name .
I don &apos;t think so ! You &apos;re just giving me Ruth so you &apos;ll get to name it when it &apos;s a boy , and that &apos;s when you &apos;ll swoop in and name him <unk> or <unk> or <unk> .
I <unk> ?
Veto .
Fine .
Unless ... You <unk> that I would figure all this out and you know that it actually is a girl , and you really do want her to be named Ruth ! Well , I &apos;m not falling for that ! Okay ? Ruth is off the table !
But Ross , you want the name Ruth !
Not like this !
Hey .
Hey . Well , what &apos;s up ?
Umm , Joey , I know .
What ?
I <unk> .
<unk> ?
I know about your feelings .
Oh my God . You do ?
Yes , and I &apos;m sorry . I-I know things worked out for Chandler and Monica , but that &apos;s very <unk> .
I know . I know . And this is so much more complicated than it was for those guys . I mean , it &apos;s Rachel for God <unk> .
For God <unk> , it &apos;s Rachel !
I know . I know . And she &apos;s not only my friend ; she &apos;s my pregnant friend ! She &apos;s my pregnant friend who &apos;s Ross &apos; ex !
Yeah that &apos;s Rachel . Beat me over the head with it .
What am I going to do ? You know , and I keep , I keep trying to get rid of these feelings , y &apos;know ? I stayed up all last night and made a list of everything I don &apos;t like about her . You want to hear it ?
Yeah .
She made me switch to light <unk> . That &apos;s it ! That &apos;s all I got ! And , you know what ? It tastes the same and my pants fit better !
Joey , I just think you &apos;re getting worked up over nothing . This is probably just a crush .
You think ?
Absolutely ! Y &apos;know , you get this rush of feelings , but then it goes away .
Yeah , just a crush ! That &apos;s all this is ! It &apos;s a crush ! I &apos;m Joey ; I don &apos;t get deep feelings .
That &apos;s right , there you go ! <unk> happen all the time ! I know I &apos;ve had them for all you guys . Well , except for Ross and Chandler . And I &apos;m sure you &apos;ve had them for us .
Not really .
Mm-hmm . <unk> me a bone here .
So , I uh ... I called the doctor and now we both know the sex of the baby .

Ross , I swear , I don &apos;t know .
Oh , come on , you know it &apos;s a girl !

Hey .
Hey .
So Rachel &apos;s all moved out huh ? How are you taking it ?
Well uh , I wanted to have a few beers , but uh , I got rid of those because Rachel couldn &apos;t stand the smell of them . But I have thrown back a lot of orange juice with <unk> though . And uh , it &apos;s a couple weeks past it &apos;s <unk> date , so it &apos;s got a bit of a kick .

Chandler , if you thought I was going to get you porn for Valentine &apos;s Day ... you were right ! Apparently , it &apos;s about a young girl who moves to the big city , you know , in search of <unk> , but ends up having sex with a lot of guys ! Yeah , it got four starts ! Oh , wait a minute . Those aren &apos;t stars . Anyway , you want to take a look ?
Well , I &apos;m not really in a sexy mood right now .

I think it &apos;s interesting .
I do too ! I missed you !
I missed you , too ! So , how was your week ?
Oh , it was good ! It was good . Actually , the baby started kicking !
How exciting !
Yeah ! I know ! It was . Oh ... the only sad thing is I wasn &apos;t around when it happened for the first time .
Oh no .
Yeah , I &apos;m missing out on all this other stuff , too . So , Joey <unk> Rachel move in with me .
Yeah right !
What ?
Joey cracks me up ! It &apos;s like , &apos; Yeah , why don &apos;t you have your ex-wife move in with you ? That wouldn &apos;t be awkward at all ! &apos;
Huh ... uh-huh .
Huh , could you imagine . I go away for a few days , and come back , and my boyfriend is living with some woman he got pregnant !
So , what &apos;d you tell him ?
Just a second !
How could you not tell Mona that Rachel is living with you ?
I don &apos;t know , she seemed to think it was such a crazy idea ! Um , plus , she , uh , she got me taffy !
<unk> , really ? I &apos;ve never had any .
Ever ? !
Well , I think my mother was too busy planning her <unk> to provide <unk> treats . Thank you ! So what , you &apos;re just never going to tell her ?
Oh , no , no , no , I will ! I just want to butter her up , first ! You know , I &apos;m going to take her to an amazing Valentine &apos;s dinner . Do all this romantic stuff , and then , just when she thinks I &apos;m the best boyfriend in the world , then I &apos;m going to tell her that my pregnant ex-girlfriend is living with me .
she &apos;s a lucky , lucky lady ! So , where are you going <unk> the mother of crap is up with this stuff ? Oh , God . Is it gum , is it food ? What &apos;s the deal ? Oh , it &apos;s nice ! May I try a pink one ?
So , between her and me being friends , and her history with Ross , it just isn &apos;t going to happen . It would be like you falling in love with a cat .
Hey !
Hey .
Hey , buddy . How &apos;s my favorite dog , huh ? How &apos;s my favorite dog ? You &apos;re <unk> . Did you give him a beer ?
No .
Will you excuse us , we need to talk for a moment .
Yeah , sure . Go ahead . Oh , me , right !
He &apos;s miserable ! What happened to him ?
Nothing . We just talked about stuff .
What stuff ?
Rachel stuff .
Oh ... Joey , you bummed him out ! This was the happiest dog in the world , and he spends half a day with you , and look at him !
He &apos;s breathing !
Okay , I &apos;m going to take him back to <unk> &apos;s .

Oh , I &apos;ve got big Valentine &apos;s plans ! I &apos;ve got my Chinese food on the way , and the rest of your <unk> taffy !
Y &apos;know , it &apos;s interesting ! Most people think that &apos;s made with <unk> , when in <unk>
Ross , we actually watched the <unk> together .
Ooh ! My Chinese food ! Let me get my cash !

Change of plans , I made you a special Valentine &apos;s dinner ! Surprise !

Oh , hey , Mona !
Hi ! Hi . Hi , Rachel ! What &apos;s she doing here ?
I have no idea !
I &apos;ll be watching TV if anybody needs me .
Seriously , what is she doing ?
Uh ... lately , she just likes hanging out here .
Why ?
I think she &apos;s lonely .
Okay , but it &apos;s Valentine &apos;s Day !
I know .
Can &apos;t we just ask her to go ?
No , no . She &apos;s way to emotional . And by emotional I mean crazy .
I &apos;m not here ! That &apos;s just my Chinese food !
Oh , my God ! She has food delivered here ?
Mm-hmm . She &apos;s-she &apos;s emotional , but , but <unk> .
You know what I &apos;m going to do ? I &apos;m going to get in my sweats , and eat this in bed !
And you thought she was going to be in our way ! So , why don &apos;t you , uh , open the champagne , and I &apos;ll be right back . I &apos;ve got a surprise for you .
You got another ex-wife back there ?
Please start drinking !
I &apos;m just going to grab the phone .
Oh , Rachel ! Wait ! Hey , I hope you don &apos;t take this the wrong way , but , but , um ... what are you doing ?
Oh , I &apos;m sorry ! Do you need the phone ?
No , no . Listen , Ross is too nice to say anything , but this is his apartment , and , and , we gotta have some <unk> , so why don &apos;t you go back to your place and give us some privacy ?
But , but , Mona , I live here .
Happy Valentine &apos;s Day ! ... Or something to remember me by .
How long has it been this time ?
90 seconds .
That &apos;s better . 90 seconds is a long time not to think about it ... except all I did was think about it .
You know , it <unk> me ? Up &apos; til now , the worst thing I ever saw , was my father doing tequila shots off the naked <unk> . After this , I would <unk> make that my <unk> !
Okay , well , we have to get past this ! Why don &apos;t we get rid of the tape and pretend it never <unk> ?
I can do that .
Okay .
Okay . Now all we &apos;ve got to do is get rid of this chair .
Oh , thank God !
Oh , I know !
Come in !
Hi ! I &apos;m so sorry to barge in on your Valentine &apos;s , but I had to get away from all the yelling . Mona is dumping Ross .
Oh , my God .
Poor Ross .
Oh , great . We have to watch him do yoga in his underwear , but for this he <unk> the drapes !
Rach , you know that <unk> tape you wanted to see ? It &apos;s here .
Oh , And We Should <unk> You , Before You Watch It don &apos;t watch it .
Why ? You saw it ? Is it scary ?
Well , let &apos;s just say it &apos;s ironic how <unk> of someone being born can make you want to kill yourself .
Well , now , wait . Now I &apos;m all freaked out . Come on , you guys will watch it with me .
No , but I will leave a sweater that smells like me right next to you !
C &apos;mon , seriously , you guys , you &apos;re not going to make me watch this alone !
She &apos;s right ... of course not . Honey , get the tape .
This reminds me of a very <unk> part of the tape . Okay , here we go .
Okay . Ooh , my ! <unk> ! Why is that baby torturing that woman ? !
Why have I seen this thing three times ? !
It &apos;s ... still beautiful .
Uh ! It &apos;s horrible !
I know ! I know , I &apos;m so sorry for you !
Oh , my God !
Wait , you guys , look !
What ? Did her ass <unk> ? !
No , the baby &apos;s out ! Look , look !
Oh , look at those little fingers and toes !
And look how happy the mom is now !
Oh ... Rach !
Oh , screw you guys , you don &apos;t have to do it !
Hey , hey , man !
Hey , what &apos;s up ?
Uh ... Mona just dumped me .
Oh , man , I &apos;m sorry . Why ?
Well , with everything that &apos;s been going on lately , I haven &apos;t exactly been the perfect boyfriend . You know , I , uh , I didn &apos;t tell her I got Rachel pregnant . I gave her a key to my apartment , and then had the <unk> changed ! And then I lied to her about Rachel moving in with me . In a way , I actually judge her for not breaking up with me sooner , you know ?
Still , that really sucks , man . Especially on Valentine &apos;s Day .
Yeah . Wait a minute . What are you doing here ? Joey Tribbiani without a date on Valentine &apos;s Day ? What &apos;s going on , huh ? Girl trouble ?
Sort of .
Really ? !
You don &apos;t have to seem so happy about it .
Oh , sorry . Well , look , maybe I can help you with it .
Oh , I ... I <unk>
Hey , whatever it is , I am sure it has happened to me . Y &apos;know , actually <unk> I got dumped during sex .
Anyway , so , uh , so what is it ?
Forget about it . It &apos;s no big deal .
C &apos;mon ! Joey ! What is it ?
It &apos;s nothing .
Hey , hey , it &apos;s me . Why can &apos;t you tell me ?
Okay , uh ... sit down . Um ... there &apos;s this woman that I like . A lot . But , uh ... it can &apos;t happen .
She &apos;s not a Tribbiani ?
No !
I knew it . So , is she someone from work ?
Yes .
Well , uh , does she like you ?
Sometimes I think maybe she could . But it doesn &apos;t matter , because I can &apos;t do anything about it .
Why not ?
Well , it &apos;s complicated . She &apos;s with this other guy . For a long time . Someone from work , too . And I could never do that to the guy , because we &apos;re really good friends .
So , uh , this guy , she used to go out with , is , uh ... is he still in love with her ?
No . I don &apos;t think so .
Okay . Um ... is he a good guy ?
Yeah , he &apos;s the best .
Then talk to him ! He might be fine with it .
Oh , I don &apos;t know .
Joey , it &apos;s worth finding out . I mean , if you really like her .
I do ! So much ! I can &apos;t stop thinking about her ! I can &apos;t sleep , I-
Okay , Joey , you know what ? You have to go for it . How often does this happen to you , huh ? You owe it to yourself .
Here &apos;s your warm milk .
I &apos;m going to ... uh ... I &apos;m going to , um , put the <unk> in it at home .
Oh , yeah .
Anyway ... seriously , uh ... just ... just talk to the guy , okay ? And tell me how it goes .
It &apos;s Rachel .
You &apos;re going to have a baby , and you need to be prepared . Now , you &apos;re going to make yourself watch the whole thing . Just do it !
I came to the big city to become a star ! I &apos;ll do ... anything to make that happen !
Anything ?
Hmm ... maybe it starts with how she gets pregnant .
There &apos;s this woman , that I like . A lot . Well , it &apos;s complicated . She &apos;s with this other guy . For a long time . And I could never do that to the guy , y &apos;know ? &apos; <unk> we &apos;re really good friends .
So , uh , this guy , she used to go out with , is , uh ... is he a good guy ?
Yeah , he &apos;s the best .
Then talk to him ! He might be fine with it .
Oh , I don &apos;t know .
Joey , it &apos;s worth finding out . I mean , if you really like her .
I do ! So much ! I can &apos;t stop thinking about her ! I can &apos;t sleep , I-
Okay , Joey , you know what ? You have to go for it . How often does this happen to you , huh ? You owe it to yourself .
It &apos;s Rachel .
Did you <unk> &apos;m sorry , did you just say it &apos;s Rachel ?
Yes .
Um , you ... you like Rachel ?

It &apos;s not a big deal ? Oh , I &apos;m sorry I just ... um , I ... what about all the stuff you-you just said ? I mean how about , I <unk> can &apos;t stop thinking about her . Like how you can &apos;t sleep ?
I &apos;m an actor , y &apos;know ? <unk> a group , we tend to be over <unk> .
Rachel who &apos;s carrying my baby ? Rachel ?
Look no , I-I know it &apos;s bad , and I know it &apos;s wrong . Okay ? But-but it &apos;s not like anything &apos;s ever gonna happen . Y &apos;know ? <unk> are just feelings , they &apos;re gonna go away .
Y &apos;know what ? I-I gotta go .

I think that &apos;s the <unk> girl ever to reject me .
Oh hey you guys !
Oh hey !
Hi !
Hey listen let me ask you , do you believe in soul mates ?
Oh yes I do . I do . I believe that there is one perfect person out there for everyone . And do you know how you find him ? You stop looking for him . That &apos;s why I stopped looking for <unk> <unk> . He &apos;ll find me .
Uh-huh , and you ?
No . I mean I believe that uh , certain people are more <unk> for each other and I believe in falling in love , but soul mates , I don &apos;t think they exist .
Okay , good .
Why ?
Well last night , I met Monica &apos;s .
What ?
Yeah , I had a date with this guy , and I swear to God , he is her other half .
Come on , don &apos;t be crazy . You don &apos;t think there &apos;s someone out there better <unk> for Monica than me , do ya ?
Well , what &apos;s he like ? !
Well he &apos;s tall .
Uh-huh .
He has brown hair .
Of course , of course .
A tall guy with hair similar to mine , oh <unk> universe !
He works with food !
Oh sure . <unk> ?
Obviously , and he &apos;s British .
Oh , I was just gonna ask !
Yeah ? And , he &apos;s-he &apos;s so <unk> and mature and confident .
Oh , it &apos;s so sad they never had a chance to meet .
<unk> , the guy she <unk> for can &apos;t hear what you &apos;re talking about .
Oh , I &apos;m so sorry . Um , and maybe I &apos;m wrong ! I <unk> &apos;know I &apos;m gonna go out with him again , I &apos;ll find out more .
You believe that this guy is <unk> for someone else and you &apos;re still gonna date him ?
Well , he may not be my soul mate , but a girl &apos;s gotta eat .
Hey .
Hey .
I just talked to Joey , I just-I want to see how you were .
Oh y &apos;know , I <unk> can &apos;t believe it . Joey and Rachel I mean it &apos;s ... It &apos;s like you and me going out , only <unk> !
All right , I know you &apos;re hurting , and-and I want to be supportive , but don &apos;t say that again .
Oh my God ! What if , what if they get married ? Then he &apos;d be the <unk> of my child .
Honey , I don &apos;t think that &apos;s something we need to worry about ! First of all he &apos;s-he &apos;s never gonna tell her how he feels about her . And even if he did you have no idea how she &apos;d react .
Sure , because women never like Joey . Y &apos;know , I think he &apos;s a virgin .
Joey ... he &apos;s not even thinking about going after Rachel !
He &apos;s not ?
No ! All he &apos;s thinking about is how you &apos;re taking this ! I mean , listen it &apos;s totally freaking him out . He &apos;s talking about moving to Vermont .
Why ?
He says he wants to leave the country . He thinks you hate him .
Hate him ? I ... No , I don &apos;t hate him . It &apos;s just it &apos;s Rachel , y &apos;know ?
Honey I can &apos;t even imagine how hard this must be for you . But , I don &apos;t want you to lose Joey over it . And right now he just needs to know that you &apos;re still his friend .
Okay . Okay , I &apos;ll talk to him .
All right . Now do it soon , he just asked me how to <unk> his dollars into Vermont money .
Oh ! Hi !

I believe in tall , handsome strangers who hit on my wife !
They &apos;re just talking , and y &apos;know what ? Just because I think they &apos;re soul mates doesn &apos;t mean anything &apos;s gonna happen .
Phoebe , good work .
Yeah ?
Yeah ! Oh he &apos;s great , I love him .
Don &apos;t worry , we &apos;ll find you someone else .

No , no I don &apos;t want to do anything to you . All right ? I just want to tell you that I &apos;m not mad at you and ... and that I certainly do not hate you . I just , I just came here to say that .
Oh <unk> Ross-Ross ! Do you <unk> come in for a beer or something ?
Uh ... yeah sure .
Do uh , do you got any beer ? <unk> I got is this <unk> stuff that Rachel left . I don &apos;t ...
Okay .
Hey look Ross , you need to understand something okay ? I uh ... I am never gonna act on this Rachel thing , okay ? I-I would never do anything to <unk> my friendship with you .
Thank you .
Anyway , it uh ... look it &apos;ll just ... take me a while to get over her , that &apos;s all . I &apos;m not even sure how to do that , I mean I &apos;ve never been in love before so ...
What ? ! You &apos;re in love with her .
Yeah , I thought you knew that .
Umm , no .
Wow . Hey look , if it helps , I don &apos;t want to feel this way . <unk> . I just keep thinking , &quot; Ah , I &apos;ll get over this . &quot; Y &apos;know ? I <unk> just keeps gettin &apos; harder . I don &apos;t , I don &apos;t know what to do . Y &apos;know ? What do I do ?
I think you need to tell her how you feel .
Okay that &apos;s the green stuff talkin &apos; .
No , I &apos;m serious . You-you need to find out where she is , because if she &apos;s not where you are , then you can start to move past this .
But what if <unk> I &apos;m not saying she will <unk> ...
If she is where you are then uh ... then my feeling weird about it shouldn &apos;t stand in the way .
Are you sure ?
Yeah . Look if-if she &apos;s gonna end up with somebody else , the truth is she couldn &apos;t find a better guy . So ...
Hey thanks .
So when do you think you &apos;re gonna talk to her ?
Oh my God I have to tell her ! I haven &apos;t even thought about what I will say . What should I say ?
I &apos;m understanding , but let &apos;s not get carried away .
I &apos;m sorry , you &apos;re right . What am I gonna say ? Oh !
Yeah , tell me about it .
... so I &apos;ve been <unk> phasing out the wine <unk> and focusing more on the cheese side of things .
Cheese you say ? That &apos;s some pretty smelly work , huh Don ?
Excuse me ?
Cheese , it &apos;s smelly . You must smell a lot of the time too .
Uh , not really . But when it comes to cheese , I &apos;m one of the people who thinks the <unk> the better .
Me too ! Yeah , Chandler can &apos;t stand it . He won &apos;t even <unk> me to have blue cheese in the house .
And you &apos;re still married to him ?
You know what I &apos;d love to do ? I would like to go to France and eat nothing but bread and <unk> even bread , just cheese . No , I want the bread . Yeah . Ah , and <unk> ... And <unk> . Oh , I &apos;m really not high , it &apos;s just I used to be fat .
Well if you where ever enter the <unk> <unk> let me know , I &apos;ve got a great little <unk> you can stay at .
Is it made of cheese ?
No . But God , a house made of cheese , wouldn &apos;t that be incredible ? !
I &apos;d move in tomorrow !
Oh come on ! Are you listening to this ?
I &apos;m so sorry .
What do we do ?
I don &apos;t know , they both want to live in a house of cheese ! I don &apos;t know how you fight that .
Okay . Okay , I can do this . I can tell her how I feel . Just uh , just stand up straight . Take a couple deep breaths . Look confident .
Joey ? What &apos;s up ?
I uh , I just came by because I-I want to talk to you about something .
Okay what &apos;s up ?

Well honey , I &apos;m late for a meeting . So can you just make it quick ?

Are you okay ? You &apos;ve been acting weird all afternoon .
Yeah , fine . Fine . Not perfect ! ! But good enough .
Jeez ! What is with you ?
I &apos;m sorry , did you say cheese ?
All right , what &apos;s going on ?
Phoebe thinks you and Don are soul mates , and I don &apos;t believe in that kind of stuff . But then you two totally get along . So look , I won &apos;t stand in your way if you want to run off with Don and live in a house of cheese .
Chandler , you don &apos;t believe in soul mates ?
No . But I &apos;m sure &apos; tomatoes &apos; does .
I don &apos;t believe in soul mates either .
You don &apos;t ?
No . I don &apos;t think that you and I were <unk> to end up together . I think that we fell in love and work hard at our relationship . Some days we work really hard .
So you ... you don &apos;t want to live with Don in a cheese house ?
No , I &apos;ve had second thoughts about that . Do you realize how hard that would be to clean ?
I love you .

Honey , you gotta talk to her .
I can &apos;t ! Y &apos;know ? You guys don &apos;t know what it &apos;s like to put yourself out there like that and just get shot down .
I don &apos;t know what that &apos;s like ? ! Up until I was 25 I thought the only <unk> to , &quot; I love you , &quot; was , &quot; Oh crap ! &quot;
Hello ? No rejection ? I got shot down at fat camp ! Boy , kids are mean when they &apos;re hungry .
All right so , so what do I do ?
This is Rachel . I mean , what are you gonna do , never going to talk to her again ? I mean I know it &apos;s weird , it &apos;s awkward , but you gotta at least try .
Yeah . Okay . Whoa ! I almost forgot this was on your ...
We didn &apos;t play it ! !
Okay , so when you &apos;re done with your tea I &apos;ll look at your leaves and tell you your <unk> .
I didn &apos;t know you read tea leaves .
Oh yeah , I &apos;ve done it for years . I actually stopped because I was so <unk> . Y &apos;know , and-and y &apos;know , one of the great <unk> of life is it &apos;s-it &apos;s <unk> <unk> . Y &apos;know ? And also tea <unk> to give me the <unk> .
Okay , I &apos;m done . Read mine .

What does yours say Pheebs ?
Umm ... Wow , all right . Wow ! Yay ! Ooh , I &apos;m gonna meet a guy ! And really soon ! And he &apos;s gonna be the man of my dreams . Probably not the guy I had a dream about last night .
Hey ! Has anyone seen my shirt ? It &apos;s a button down , like a , like a faded salmon ?
You mean your pink shirt ?
<unk> salmon color .
No , I-I haven &apos;t seen your pink shirt .
Great ! Great . Then I must &apos;ve left it at Mona &apos;s . I knew it !
Well , I &apos;m sure you get another one at Ann Taylor &apos;s .
That &apos;s my favorite shirt ! Okay ? I love that shirt !
Well just ask Mona to give it back !
I don &apos;t know . I mean I-I guess I could . It &apos;s just that we didn &apos;t really end things such good terms . And if I go over there I &apos;d be <unk> the one thing she asked me to do when we broke up , jump up my own ass and die .
Oh wait a second you guys ... for the last couple weeks I &apos;ve been that guy everywhere I go . We take the same bus . We go to the same <unk> , the same dry cleaners ; maybe he &apos;s the tea guy .
Phoebe , did you see that ? ! He totally checked you out ! He is so cute ! Mine has a picture of The <unk> People , what does that mean ?
Hi !
Hey .
Hi .
Hi .
<unk> gives Phoebe the <unk> .
So I thought Joey and I would be okay once we hung out , but it &apos;s not even like we know how to be with each other anymore .
I know it &apos;s tough now , but things will get better .
How do you know that ? What if it just gets worse and worse and worse , to the point where we can &apos;t even be in the same room with each other ? !
I &apos;m not great at the advice , can I interest you in a sarcastic comment ? Some cheese ?
Honey , what is the <unk> <unk> CD in the <unk> Stevens case ?
Let &apos;s just say if I can &apos;t find the right CD case I just put it in the <unk> one .
Okay , where is the <unk> Stevens CD ?
In the James Taylor case .
Where is the James Taylor CD ?
Honey , I &apos;m gonna save you some time , 200 CDs , not one of them in the right case .
Okay . No need to <unk> . <unk> <unk> everyone . Okay umm uh , we &apos;re just gonna have to spend some time and put the CDs in the right cases .
Well , if we &apos;re gonna do that we should come up with some kind of order . Y &apos;know <unk> or by <unk> ?
Hmm , I don &apos;t know . We really have to talk this through .
Oh my God ! ! You guys have such problems ! ! I feel so terrible for you !
Okay , I-I &apos;m sorry . You and Joey , your both focusing on this uncomfortable thing , what you need to do is to change the subject . Next time you see him try to get him talking about something else .
Oh yeah . That makes sense .
Yeah , like I don &apos;t know , maybe you have a work problem that you need his advice on .
Ooh , I can do that .
Good . Uh honey , the <unk> <unk> <unk> ? Really ?
They were just giving those away at the store in exchange for money .

Oh hey , you should be excited about him . There &apos;s nothing wrong with him he &apos;s a good guy .
You think ?
Yeah . Ya know what I think ; I think we were all just being too negative .
You &apos;re right . You &apos;re right , he &apos;s just <unk> life . We could all stand to be a little more like Parker . You know what ? I am like him ! I &apos;m a <unk> , positive person .
Actually , you have a little bit of an edge .
What &apos;s that now ?
Nothing ...
Oh look it &apos;s Parker !
Look ! It &apos;s the bunny hop !
Oooh I love it !
You do ? !
Are you kidding ? People acting like animals to music . Come on !
Okay it &apos;s time for the toast ! Umm now-now , I know that Ross usually gives the toast , but this year I &apos;m going to do it .
No , no it &apos;s going to be great . Really ! Mom , Dad , when I got married , one of the things that made me sure I could do it was the amazing example the two of you set for me . For that and so many other things I want to say thank you . I know I probably don &apos;t say it enough , but I love you . When I look around this room , I &apos;m-I &apos;m <unk> by the thought of those who could not be here with us . Nana , my <unk> grandmother who would so want to be here , but she can &apos;t because she &apos;s dead . As is our dog Chi-Chi . I mean look how cute she is . . Was . Do me a favor and pass this to my parents . Remember she &apos;s dead . Okay , her and Nana , gone . Wow ! Hey does anybody remember when <unk> <unk> had to say goodbye to her children in <unk> of <unk> ? Didn &apos;t see that ? No movie fans ? ! You want to hear something sad ? The other day I was watching 60 Minutes these <unk> in Romania , who have been so <unk> , they were <unk> of love . You people are made of <unk> ! Here &apos;s to mom and dad ! Whatever !
Thank you Monica that was uh , interesting . Wasn &apos;t it interesting , Jack ?
Why don &apos;t I remember this dog ?
Ross , why don &apos;t you give us your toast now ?
Oh , no , Mom , it &apos;s just Monica this year .
You &apos;re not going to say anything ? On our 35th wedding anniversary ?
No , of course , Um ... Um , everybody ? Um , I-I just wanted to say ... on behalf of my new bride , Rachel , and myself . Umm , that if ... if in <unk> years , we &apos;re half as happy as you guys are , we &apos;ll count ourselves the luckiest people in the world .
Oh Ross ...

Is something wrong ?
Wrong ? Really ? You know the word wrong . Everything isn &apos;t perfect ? Everything isn &apos;t magical ? Everything isn &apos;t a <unk> with the light of a million <unk> ? They were just <unk> lights , Parker !
Well , excuse me for putting a good spin on a <unk> jam !
You don &apos;t have to put a good spin on everything .
I &apos;m sorry that &apos;s who I am . I &apos;m a positive person .
No ! I am a positive person . You are like Santa Clause on <unk> , at <unk> , getting <unk> !
So what do you want me to do , you want me to be more negative , less happy ?
<unk> less happy !
Fine ! Well then to <unk> Ross , &quot; I &apos;d better be going . &quot;
So long ! Don &apos;t let the best door in the world hit you in the ass on your way out !
Isn &apos;t this the most incredible fight you &apos;ve ever had in your entire life ?
Uh huh .
... and then , we could &apos;ve gone from the ceremony to the reception with you in the <unk> !
Ross , it just wouldn &apos;t have been <unk> .
But having a <unk> place the ring on your finger would &apos;ve been no problem ?
It was really fun being married to you tonight .
Yeah ! And ! And , it was the <unk> 400 bucks I &apos;ve ever made .
Okay Ross , can I uh , can I ask you something ?
Yeah .
That proposal , at the planetarium ...
I know , I know it was stupid .
Are you kidding ? ! With the , with the <unk> , and-and the song , and the stars ! It was ... really wonderful ! Did you just make that up ?
No , actually I thought about it when , when we were going out . It &apos;s how I <unk> I uh , I would ask you to marry me .
Well , that would &apos;ve been very hard to say no too .
It &apos;s a good thing I didn &apos;t do it , because it sounds like it would &apos;ve been a very expensive wedding . Okay , good night .
<unk> .
Even if the <unk> had a <unk> so your hair wouldn &apos;t get messed up ?
I will think about it .
That &apos;s all I &apos;m <unk> &apos; .
Okay that &apos;s it . I give up . At mom and dad &apos;s <unk> anniversary , you &apos;re the one giving the speech .
Y &apos;know I don &apos;t understand why they didn &apos;t cry . It was a beautiful speech .

Oh good God , Ross ! How the hell do you do it ?

So did they call you to tell you your name &apos;s gonna be in this ?
No . They really like me over there . They want to do a big <unk> on me , but I said no .
Why &apos;d you say no ?
Remember what happened the last time I did an interview for them ? I said I write a lot of my own lines , and then the <unk> got mad and made my character fall down the elevator shaft . So who knows what I might say this time .
If only there was something in your head to control the things you say .
Oh , come on Joey ! You will totally keep it in check this time , and plus y &apos;know the <unk> would be really good for your career ! And you deserve that ! And if you do the interview you can mention , oh I don &apos;t know , gal pal Rachel Green ?
Is that gal pal spelled <unk> ?
Okay , don &apos;t listen to him . Please ?
Fine ! All right , I &apos;ll do it . But hey ! You guys have to be at the next table so you can stop me if I y &apos;know , start to say something stupid .
Just then or-or all the time , &apos; cause we-we have jobs y &apos;know .
Come on ! We will be there for you the whole time ! Just remember gal pal Rachel Green . Ha-ha ! I &apos;m gonna be in Soap Opera Digest ! And not just in the dumb crossword puzzle . Seriously , proud of you .
Yeah .
I really appreciate you taking the time to do this .
Oh , not at all . Happy to do it .

No , we &apos;re just four people with neck problems . You talk like this .
Y &apos;know I think its great you wanted to meet here . Y &apos;know when most people hear the magazine is paying for it they want to go to a big fancy restaurant .
Actually , I didn &apos;t know the magazine was paying for it . Wouldn &apos;t have <unk> , I &apos;m doing this for the fans , not for the free food .

Well , given that we forgot to invite her it would be an awfully big coincidence if she was .
My God !
Well it wasn &apos;t my fault , Phoebe was in charge of the invitations !
Well I don &apos;t , I don &apos;t have a mother so often I forget that other people ...
Oh give it a rest !

Phoebe , <unk> &apos;s mad at you too . It-it doesn &apos;t bother you ?
No look , we &apos;ve apologized twice ! I can &apos;t do anymore than that . I know you hate it when people are mad at you but you just have to be okay with it .
Okay . I can do that . I gotta go powder my ass .
Look at that face ! Just like when you were in high school ! If I didn &apos;t know better I &apos;d say you were a cheerleader in trouble . Come on , let &apos;s get some tea .
Okay .
Oh my look at that . Only three weeks to go , now have you picked your nanny yet ? Now I don &apos;t want you to use your <unk> &apos; cause it would just split her focus .
Oh well actually gonna use a nanny and uh , I don &apos;t even have a <unk> .
It &apos;s like you &apos;re a <unk> person . Rachel , you must get a nanny . You don &apos;t know how overwhelming this is going to be . I mean when you were a baby I had full time help , I had Mrs. Kay .

I &apos;ll take a card .
Okay , you picked the <unk> card ! You get all of Ross &apos;s points !
What ? !
This game is kinda fun .
You don &apos;t think it &apos;s a little crazy that you get all my points just &apos; cause you ...
I don &apos;t think the contestants are supposed to speak to each other .
Why did you invite my mother ? !
What ?
She wants to move in with me and Ross to help take care of the baby .
For how long ?
Eight weeks . I mean I love my mother , but my God , a long lunch with her is <unk> .
I personally would be <unk> if she wanted to live with me .
She can &apos;t hear you .
What ? You guys , come on ! What am I going to do ?
Well , if you don &apos;t want your mother to move in with you , just tell her .
You &apos;re right . You &apos;re right . I mean I &apos;m about to have a baby , I can tell my mother that I don &apos;t want her to just be sleeping on my couch ! Oh my God ! She &apos;s gonna want to sleep in my bed with me . This cannot happen !
That &apos;s right . That is right , you go over there and tell her you don &apos;t want her to live with you . Do not take no for an answer !
Okay .
This is great ! Now she &apos;s gonna be mad at Rachel ! Y &apos;know what ? And I &apos;m just gonna swoop in there and be like the daughter she never had .
I have new respect for Chandler . All right everybody ! It &apos;s time to open the presents !
Yes ! Yes ! And I think that the first gift that Rachel <unk> should be from the grandmother of the baby , because you &apos;re the most important person in this room . And in the world !
Well uh , I don &apos;t have a gift because I wasn &apos;t invited until the last minute , but thank you so much for bringing that to everyone &apos;s attention .
How about you less important people , let &apos;s open your presents !
Mom that &apos;s okay that you didn &apos;t get you a gift !
Well , I kinda did . Me . Eight weeks of me .
Oh yeah . Okay , see mom , the truth is I can do this on my own .
Sweetheart I know you &apos;re gonna be terrific mom , I just think you need a little help , especially at the beginning .
But mom , I really know what I &apos;m doing . I can handle this .
Really ? Remember <unk> ?

Oh <unk> course I know that . I mean of course you never leave a baby alone ! I mean who <unk> wouldn &apos;t be safe as she would be with me , the baby <unk> . Oh God , okay . Y &apos;know what ?

How are you ?
I &apos;m fine , but that &apos;s not important . What &apos;s important is how was she ?
Uhh , it was fun . We , we just had coffee .
Oh uh-huh , uh-huh , coffee , a little <unk> under the table .
What &apos;s uh , what &apos;s going on ? Do you not , do you not like Katie ?
No ! No , she <unk> was nice . I mean , she &apos;s a little slutty , but who isn &apos;t ?
I liked her .
Of course you did Ross , you would date a gorilla if it called you Indiana Jones !
Did you get like a fresh batch of pregnancy hormones today ? !
No ! It &apos;s just that , Kate <unk> me .
Why ? What was wrong with her ?
There was nothing wrong with her ! All right ? She was perfectly lovely !
Okay , so what &apos;s the matter ?
I don &apos;t want you to date her !
Why ? What , what are you jealous ?
Yes ! And not because I want you to go out with me , but because I don &apos;t want you to go out with anybody ! Okay ? I know it &apos;s a terrible thing to even think this , and it &apos;s completely inappropriate , but I want you to be at my constant <unk> and call 24 hours a day ! I &apos;m very sorry , but that is just the way that I feel .
Okay .
What ? !
I won &apos;t date . I &apos;ll uh , I &apos;ll be here , with you , all the time .
Really ? But I &apos;m being so unreasonable .
<unk> , but you &apos;re allowed to be unreasonable . You &apos;re having our baby .
Oh Ross , thank you . Thank you .
Do you feel better ?
No , not really . You &apos;re pressing the baby into my bladder and now I have to pee . Sorry .

Just one thing umm ...
Uh-huh .

Okay . Okay . Because for a minute you said you ...

Oh , look ! <unk> for <unk> ! Want to feel good about yourself ?
What the hell !
Okay .
All right , let &apos;s start with some <unk> . Can anybody tell me what the difference between <unk> and <unk> is ?
Yeah , this was a stupid idea .
Hey ! What are you guys looking at ?
Oh , it &apos;s a poster for that <unk> War I movie that I &apos;m in , check it out .
Yeah ? Wow ! It looks really <unk> !
Uh-huh ! I know . I &apos;m coming soon to a theater near you ! I &apos;m in <unk> ! I &apos;m <unk> for children !

Oh I love taking <unk> when nobody died !
Well obviously I won &apos;t be able to come , for those of you who haven &apos;t checked their <unk> today is my due date . Well y &apos;know , I just want to take a moment and thank you guys for how great you &apos;ve been during this time . I really couldn &apos;t have done it without you . And I have loved these last nine months ! And even though I am so looking forward to the next part , I am really gonna miss being pregnant .
That &apos;s right , still no baby ! Come on people ! Please make some room !
Uh sweetie , maybe you &apos;d be more comfortable here ?
You . Like you haven &apos;t done enough .
Look , I-I know how miserable you are , I wish there was something I can do . I mean I wish I were a <unk> . Because with <unk> it &apos;s the male , they carry the babies . And then also umm , I &apos;d be far away in the sea .
God . I have never been so uncomfortable in my entire life !
Oh I know , I &apos;ve been there . I remember toward the end ...
Oh Phoebe , that &apos;s a great story . Can you tell it to me when you &apos;re getting me some iced tea ? Oh God , get out ! Get out ! ! Get out ! ! Get out ! !
Let &apos;s .
Hey ! Did you have the baby yet ?
Do you want me to come over there and sit on you ? &apos; Cause I &apos;ll do it .
What are you doing here so early ?
They sent me home from work . They were like , &quot; <unk> your maternity leave now ! Just rest , get ready for the baby . &quot; Well y &apos;know what ? <unk> &apos; em ! If they don &apos;t want me there , I &apos;ll just hang out with you guys .
Or you can do volunteer work .
Hello ?
Joey ! It &apos;s Estelle ! Great news , I was able to get you and one guest tickets to your premiere .
One guest ? You told me I can have six tickets !
Well , I sold four of them on <unk> . You &apos;ll be sitting next to <unk> .
Oh my God . So that &apos;s it ? ! I only get to bring one guest ?
Yeah , what time do you wanna pick me up ? Hello ?
Did you hear that ? I only get one extra ticket to my premiere . So some how I have to pick between you three and Ross .
What-what about me ?
You said you didn &apos;t want to go .
I don &apos;t . But I would still like to be <unk> . What ? Just because I &apos;m pregnant you think I &apos;m invisible .
Definitely not invisible .
Well , well Ross didn &apos;t care enough to be here , so I think he &apos;s out . You <unk> you lose .
He &apos;s not <unk> , he &apos;s teaching a class .
Well then somebody &apos;s <unk> . Joey , not that this uh should <unk> you at all , but if you were to pick me , I was planning on wearing a <unk> dress , cut down to here .
I haven &apos;t seen this dress .
Star in a movie .
Joey , you pick who ever you want . Okay ? You just listen to your heart . What does it tell you ? Phoebe , Phoebe .
Well uh ... I think I want to take Chandler .
<unk> !
You really want to take me ?
Yeah ! Yeah ! I mean I &apos;m sorry , I wish I can take everybody , but y &apos;know Chandler always supported my career . He &apos;s paid for acting classes and head shots and stuff and well this will be my way of paying you back .
So you &apos;re never actually going to pay me back ?
Wait a minute , just because he paid for your head shots you &apos;re gonna take him ? Joey , I don &apos;t think you &apos;re <unk> just how slutty this dress is !
It &apos;s not just the stuff he paid for , I mean it &apos;s-it &apos;s everything . Y &apos;know ? He read lines with me . He-he went with me on auditions when I was really nervous , and then he <unk> me after I didn &apos;t get parts that I really wanted . You always believed in me man . Even , even when I didn &apos;t believe in myself .
I always knew you were gonna make it . I &apos;m so proud of you .
Thanks . That means a lot to me .
Mon , maybe one of these guys wants to wear your dress .
I &apos;m gonna go shave .
Yeah well , I &apos;m gonna go spit .
Oh , I have to pee . If I don &apos;t come out in five minutes it &apos;s because I &apos;ve choked to death on the potpourri stink .
When she comes out , you hold her nose , I &apos;ll blow in her mouth , and the kid will just right out of her .
She &apos;s over a week late ! She gotta have it today , right ?
I don &apos;t know . I-I think it &apos;s still gonna be a while .
Hmm , care to make it interesting ? I &apos;ll bet you that she &apos;ll have it by this time tomorrow .
You &apos;re on !
Okay , how much ?
One hundred thousand dollars !
How about fifty bucks ?
Fine ! I &apos;ll call <unk> and move some money around .
All right , who &apos;s turn is it to help me get up !
No one &apos;s here ! Oh damnit !
This is so exciting ! It &apos;s so <unk> ! People taking our picture . How do I look ?
A little tall .
What ?
Do you mind <unk> down a little bit , so that I look taller ? There you go .
It &apos;s just so <unk> .
Oh hey Mon ? Rach is here ! Ohh , you &apos;re still pregnant . Oh , I &apos;m sorry . I know how uncomfortable you are . Y &apos;know what ? You look great . Yeah , like fifty bucks .
Oh , I have to go pee . Apparently this baby thinks that my bladder is a squeeze toy .
Damnit ! Damnit ! ! Here &apos;s your fifty bucks !
It &apos;s interesting that you lost . Now , I forget , do you like to lose ?
Now stop it ! Double or nothing that she has it by tomorrow !
Fine ! You &apos;re on !
Okay .
Until then , General <unk> , why don &apos;t you set up camp right there .
Hey is Rachel here ? We have a doctor &apos;s appointment .
She &apos;s in the bathroom .
Rach , we gotta go .
In a minute ! ! !
People ask me why we &apos;re not together , I just don &apos;t know what to tell them .
All right , all right . Let &apos;s go !
Uh , do you wanna go change first ? The doctor &apos;s keeping the office open late for us , but if you hurry ...
No , I &apos;m fine .
Really ? You don &apos;t think that &apos;s a little inappropriate .
Good God man don &apos;t anger it .
Ross , it is 100 <unk> outside . For the first time in weeks , I am <unk> comfortable .
Fine ! Fine ! Y &apos;know what ? Whatever you want . Okay ? You &apos;re the mommy .
Oh uh-uh pal ! Don &apos;t call me mommy ! It &apos;s bad enough you call your own mother that .
I &apos;m actually with her on this one .
&quot; I thought I knew who the <unk> was , but it was you all along . &quot;
Okay , this is it . It &apos;s my big fight scene coming up .
Ross .
Yeah ?
Can I ask you something ?
Uh-huh .
When Carol was pregnant with Ben ...
Mmm ?
... were you this <unk> ?
Wow !
Excuse me ? !
Oh nothing . Nothing ! Just uh , you &apos;ve been a little short with me lately . I &apos;m not trying to <unk> you .
Well then you just must have a natural <unk> for it .
Y &apos;know what ? The doctor will be in soon , why don &apos;t we not speak until then .
Okay . Seriously , breathe <unk> Ross ! That &apos;s great !
Y &apos;know we should probably ask the doctor if she even knows how to <unk> a baby that &apos;s half human and half pure evil !
Hi Dr. Long , how are you ?
Oh , you &apos;re nice to her .
She has the drugs !
We &apos;ll do a quick check .
Okay .
So , eight days late huh ?
Yeah .
You must be a little uncomfortable .
Eh , just a <unk> .
You &apos;re about 80 percent <unk> , so you &apos;re on your way . It still could last a little while longer . If you &apos;re <unk> there are a few ways to help things along .
Do them ! !
Actually , they &apos;re things you can do . Just some home <unk> , but in my experience I &apos;ve found that some of them are quite effective .
Well , we are ready to try anything .
Okay , there &apos;s an herbal tea you can drink .
Okay .
You can take some <unk> oil , there &apos;s eating spicy <unk> ...
Great ! We will do all of those .
... taking a long walk , and then there &apos;s the one that &apos;s proved most effective : sex .
You &apos;ve got to be kidding me !
Good job Joe ! Well done ! Top notch !
You liked it ? You really liked it ?
Oh-ho-ho , yeah !
Which part exactly ?
The whole thing ! Can we go ?
Oh no-no-no , give me some specifics .
I love the specifics , the specifics were the best part !
Hey , what about the scene with the kangaroo ? Did-did you like that part ?
I was surprised to see a kangaroo in a <unk> War I epic .
You fell asleep ! ! There was no kangaroo ! They didn &apos;t take any of my suggestions ! That &apos;s for coming buddy . I &apos;ll see you later .
Don &apos;t go ! I &apos;m sorry . I &apos;m so sorry ! Look ! This guy fell asleep ! He fell asleep too ! Be mad at him ! Or , call an <unk> .
Hey !
Hey .
Hi !
What did the doctor say ? Any news on when the baby will come ?
No . But she did give us some ideas on how to <unk> labor .
Yeah , we tried them all . We went for a walk , uh we tried a special tea , <unk> oil , spicy food nothing has worked .
Well , there is one thing that we haven &apos;t tried , but someone thinks that , &quot; That will open up a can of <unk> . &quot;
Well what is it ? What is it ? If it &apos;s gonna help bring the baby here , like today . I mean , I think you should do it .
It &apos;s sex .
Do it !
Monica !
I &apos;m just saying it &apos;s been a really long time for you . I mean , women have needs . Do it , get yours !
Oh I-I don &apos;t know about that . No , I think that if the two of you had sex <unk> <unk> would be <unk> .
All right , let &apos;s be practical , if Ross isn &apos;t willing to do it , he &apos;s not the only guy in the world you can have sex with . You can borrow <unk> is good !
Monica , what is the matter with you ?
Nothing . I just want the baby to be born today .
Why ? Why today ?
Okay fine ! I keep betting Phoebe that you &apos;re gonna have the baby and I don &apos;t want to lose again !
What ? ! While she &apos;s been going through this hell , you &apos;ve been making money ? ! You &apos;re betting on your friend staying in this misery ? !
I &apos;ll take that bet .
What ? !
Well , I &apos;m miserable here ! I might as well make some money out it !
Can I get some of that action ?
Wait a minute ! Now I &apos;m betting against all three of you ?
Oh honey , don &apos;t worry . I really do feel like tomorrow &apos;s the day .
Oh , okay !
Hey ! <unk> beauty !
Where have you been ? ! I tried to call you ! I want to talk to you ! I still feel so bad !
Oh no , were you upset ? Did you lose sleep ?
I &apos;m so sorry .
Uh-huh look , the only reason I can over here was to settle things between us ! Okay ? You &apos;ve done a lot for me and my career , I wanted to pay you back so I took you to the premiere but you missed it ! Okay , so how much do I owe you ?
What ? !
Give me a number , I don &apos;t want to owe you anything !
You don &apos;t owe me anything , I don &apos;t want you money ...
Ah-ah-ah ! We &apos;re doing this ! Okay , now you got me my first set of head shots . Right , how much were those ?
I don &apos;t know , five hundred dollars ?
Okay , five hundred dollars . What else ?
Well then there was the second set , the <unk> <unk> head shots .
Okay , so that &apos;s another five hundred . Five hundred and five hundred , that &apos;s ...
Do you want a <unk> ?
Please !
Here !
All right , what else ?
Well uh , there was acting classes , stage <unk> classes , tap classes ...
Which we &apos;re still keeping under our hats !
Uh then there was that <unk> coach who helped you with that play where you needed a southern accent . Which after twenty hours of lessons still came out <unk> .
What the hell are you talking about , &quot; The south will <unk> again man . &quot;
Yes , money well spent !
Yeah . Okay , what else ? <unk> !
Okay , two , three years of rent , <unk> , food ...
Okay . Okay , so I &apos;m writing you a check for ... So you fell asleep during my movie . Big deal right ? How do you clear this thing ?

Okay here , have one of these <unk> . Oh ha ... Oh God ! So ... so hot ! Oh <unk> By the way , you don &apos;t want to touch the <unk> and then touch your eye .
I am feeling nothing . <unk> of hot , watching you do that really makes me want to have sex with you .
Stop it .
Oh come on Ross , why are we wasting our time with this other stuff ? ! We know what &apos;s gonna work ! It &apos;s doctor <unk> !
I &apos;m sorry , but we have to have some <unk> ! My God , I &apos;m dying .
Oh come on Ross , we &apos;ve done it before we &apos;ll do it again , it &apos;ll be a nice way to <unk> the pregnancy .
This is insane , I &apos;m not gonna make love to you just so that you &apos;ll go into labor .
Make love ? What are you a girl ?
Always a great way to get in a man &apos;s pants .
But you will , you will be <unk> a service . Okay ? Just-just think of me as a ketchup bottle , y &apos;know you sometimes you have to bang on the end of it just to get something to come out .
I love when you talk dirty to me .
Oh , I know it . You &apos;re right . That &apos;s not sexy . Oh ... Oh ! Whoops ! Oh , I seem to have dropped my <unk> . Let me just bed over and get it . Oh God !
Okay enough ! This is , this is not going to happen .
Come on Ross ! I &apos;m miserable here ! Come on ! You started this , now you finish it ! Come on <unk> , make love to me .
Y &apos;know what ?

Forget it .
Oh wow ! What now Ross you &apos;re not gonna talk ? How on <unk> will you ever <unk> me ? Oh wait a minute , I know . I mean you &apos;d think the damn <unk> would &apos;ve <unk> up your <unk> , but no ! ! That &apos;s not enough ... What are you doing ? !

Look , we &apos;ve always talked about having babies someday . I &apos;m not saying it has to be right now , but I &apos;m starting to think that we can handle it . We &apos;re good . We &apos;re really good .
We are pretty good .
But nothing has to happen until your ready .
Well maybe I &apos;m ready now . I mean , it &apos;s a little scary , but maybe it &apos;s right .
What ? ! It &apos;s not right ! We &apos;re not ready to have a kid now ! !
What ? ! !
I &apos;m kidding . This is going to be fun .
So we &apos;re gonna try ? I mean , are we trying ?

Okay , how long was I watching that woman ?
I &apos;m just saying that y &apos;know , someday Ross is gonna meet somebody and ... he &apos;s gonna have his own life . Right ?
