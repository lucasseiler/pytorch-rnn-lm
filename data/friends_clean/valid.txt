Oh , okay that explains it . I got a call at two in the morning , but all I could hear was , like , this high <unk> sound , so I thought okay its like a mouse or a opossum . But then I realized where would a mouse or a opossum get the money to make the phone call .

Monica , you broke up with him for a reason .
I know , I know . I &apos;m just so tired of-of missing him . I &apos;m tired of wondering why hasn &apos;t he called . Why hasn &apos;t he called !

Well , I &apos;m crazy about her now . I think this could be the real thing . Capital &apos; R &apos; ! Capital &apos; T &apos; ! Don &apos;t worry , those are the right letters .
Look , what do you want me to say ?
I want you to say that you like her !
I can &apos;t . It &apos;s like this <unk> thing , you know . Every time she starts laughing , I just wanna pull my arm off just so that I can have something to throw at her .
Thanks for trying . Oh , and by the way there is no Count Rushmore !
Yeah , then-then who &apos;s the guy that painted the faces on the mountain ?
How could you have told her ?
Ross , I didn &apos;t think it would that big of a deal .
Oh , she didn &apos;t think it would be that big of deal .
Okay , who are you talking to when you do that ?
Look , that was supposed to be like a private , personal thing between us .
Okay , Ross , Phoebe is my girlfriend , okay , we tell each other everything . You know , I mean , come on , guys do the same thing , I mean , what about all that <unk> room stuff .
That &apos;s different , okay . That &apos;s like , uh &apos; Who dated a stripper ? &apos; or &apos; Who did it on the back of the <unk> Island <unk> ? &apos; .
Were both of those Joey ?
Yeah . Look , you don &apos;t , you don &apos;t talk about like , you know , your girlfriend and the intimate stuff you , you do with her .
Not even with your best friend .
Noo !
That is so sad . Your missing out on so much , Ross . I mean , the bonding and the sharing , you know . And-and knowing that someone else is going through the same thing you are .
Hmph . So what you , you tell each other everything ?
Pretty much .
Did you talk about the night of five times ? Do you tell people about the night of five times ?
Uh , honey , yeah that was with Carol .
I know , but it &apos;s still worth mentioning , I think .
Relax every <unk> in your body . Listen to the <unk> music . Okay , now close you eyes , and think of a happy place . Okay , tell me your happy place .
Richard &apos;s living room , drinking wine .
All right . No , no , no , not a Richard thing , just put down the glass . And get out !
I &apos;m sorry , but that &apos;s my happy place .
Well , okay , fine , use my happy place . Okay , I &apos;m just gonna , I have to ask that you don &apos;t move anything .
All right , I &apos;ll try not to .
Okay , all right , so , your in a meadow , millions of stars in the sky ....
Do you think breaking up with him was a huge mistake ?
All right , there are no questions in the happy place . Okay , just , the warm breeze , and the moonlight <unk> through the trees ....
I &apos;ll bet he &apos;s totally over me , I &apos;ll bet he &apos;s fine .
All right , betting and <unk> of any kind , are , I &apos;m sure , not <unk> in the happy place . Okay . Just-just , you know , the-the lovely <unk> , and the , the <unk> <unk> . And the-the <unk> sounds of the babbling <unk> ....
Okay , this isn &apos;t working . I &apos;m still awake and now I have to pee .
So , I hear , you hate me !
I , ah , I never said hate , I was very careful about that .
A little <unk> told me something about you wanting to rip your arm off and throw it at me .
And you got a &apos; hate &apos; from that ? ! Your taking a big <unk> there ...
All right , fine , fine , fine , fine , fine , We &apos;ve got to do something about our little situation here Joey . So , this is my idea you and me spending some <unk> time together .
But what does that gonna do ...

Okay . I &apos;m in .
Okay . All right . This is what we &apos;re gonna call it &apos; Joey and Janice &apos;s DAY OF FUN ! &apos;

Yes , because that &apos;s how long it takes to love me .
Yeah , I know , I sleep in the next room .
So , I went down to the post office , and it turns out it was those <unk> that I ordered for Richard about the Civil War . He loved the Civil War .
Monica , do you want us to take you home ?

Umm , yeah .
No Chandler , everything ! Like stuff you like , stuff she likes , <unk> , <unk> , girth ....
