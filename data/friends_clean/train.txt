I can &apos;t think of anything .
Come on Ross , you &apos;re a paleontologist , dig a little <unk> .
Wait a minute , is it because Joey and I didn &apos;t invite him to that Knicks game a couple of weeks ago ?
Do you think that &apos;s something that he &apos;d be mad at you for ?
I guess it could .
Well then I think that &apos;s it .
Well , if he &apos;s angry , he really shouldn &apos;t just cover it up . I-I wish he would just tell me the truth .
Oh , if that &apos;s what you want you then you really should run his head under hot water and bang his head against a table .
Honey I made a <unk> at <unk> <unk> , is that okay ?
Yeah that &apos;s great . But first , wait , talk to me , talk to me . Tell me about your day .
It was fine .

Okay . Well , apparently Chandler &apos;s angry at us for not getting him a ticket to that Knicks game a couple of weeks ago .
Oh , we &apos;re supposed to just get him a ticket ? ! That guy is always <unk> off of us !
Yeah ! Anyway , I-I still think we should try to patch things up , y &apos;know ? Like uh , maybe we could get him to get tickets to another Knicks game and invite him .
Oh wow that &apos;s a great idea ! And I still have his credit card .
Here you go .
Oh .

Some guy bought it . I &apos;m sorry . I tired to stop it but they put me in jail !
They put you in jail ?
The little jail between the doors !
Phoebe , I asked you to guard the ring !
I know , I &apos;m sorry ! But y &apos;know , this ring is better ! Monica never even saw the other ring .
Yeah but when he <unk> to me with the ring I got <unk> bumps .
Maybe it was the guy .
It was the ring !
Hey ! So uh , was he excited about the tickets ?
No ! He blew us off !
What ? !
I know !
I can &apos;t believe it . Can I tell you something ? I &apos;m a little mad at him now .
Can I tell you something ? Me too .
Y &apos;know what ? He didn &apos;t want to talk to us about being angry , well maybe we don &apos;t talk to him at all !

Okay , hold on real quick , hold on a second let me just uh , get a little more comfortable here . Wait , now wait a second , this isn &apos;t too <unk> is it ?
No . What ever happened to that little dude . So full of dreams ...
I don &apos;t care about the little dude ! I can &apos;t ! I cannot listen to anymore of this ! Y &apos;know , the only person who would want to listen to this is a mental health professional ! And then it &apos;s only because they get paid $ 100 an hour ! Do you know how much money I could &apos;ve made listening to you ? $ 2,000 ! And do you know when I figured that out ? While you were talking !
What ? ! I can &apos;t believe you &apos;re trying to <unk> me ! When just 14 hours ago we figured out that that is exactly what my mother was trying to do to me !
Oh ... I &apos;m sorry . I ... I-I don &apos;t <unk> didn &apos;t mean to <unk> you . I ... This is all just a little overwhelming .
Oh Rachel , I &apos;m so sorry . I didn &apos;t mean to <unk> you . It &apos;s just that , when those <unk> open , you ... Hard to close &apos; em . But they are closed now . Believe me .
I &apos;m so glad , I &apos;m so glad you <unk> . And I &apos;m glad that you &apos;re done . What do you say we umm ...
I would really like that .
That was ... so good .
Hey .
I can &apos;t believe I let you talk me into buying this stupid gumball machine looking ring !
It &apos;s not a stupid gumball machine looking ring ! It &apos;s a beautiful ring !
No , it &apos;s not ! When I looked at the other ring I could see Monica &apos;s face when I gave it to her , y &apos;know ? And I could see her saying yes . When I look at this ring , all I see is a ring ! Unless I look at it really <unk> and then I can see my own eye . Look , this is the most important thing I &apos;m gonna do in my life . I wanna make sure it &apos;s perfect .
Okay . There may be a way that we can get the other ring back . &apos; Cause I heard the guy tell the <unk> where he was going to propose . So maybe we can get him to trade rings or something .
I can &apos;t do that .
Well you certainly can &apos;t give her that stupid gumball ring .
There he is !
Okay and he hasn &apos;t <unk> yet because she has no ring on her finger .
Wow ! You &apos;re good ! After this , we should solve crimes .
Yeah ! Okay , go , go , go get him .
Oh , okay . Excuse me sir ? Could you come with me please ? You have a phone call .
Who is it ?
It is your office .
Do you know who at my office ?
John ?
Oh John ! Great !
Here he is .
Hi ! Hi . Okay , there was a <unk> <unk> at the jewelry store , the ring you &apos;re about to propose with was supposed to be held for me . So , I &apos;m gonna need to have that back . But , in exchange I &apos;m willing to trade you this beautiful , more expensive ring . Ew .
Wow ! I would trade .
It is beautiful , but I &apos;m gonna use this one . Now , if you &apos;ll excuse me .
No-no ! This is my <unk> and her heart was set on that ring . You don &apos;t want to break her heart now do you ?
Yeah , do you want to break a dying woman &apos;s heart ?
You &apos;re dying ? !
Yeah , she &apos;s dying ... Of a cough apparently .
Yes , and it is my dying wish to have that ring . See , if I &apos;m not <unk> with that ring then my spirit is going to wander the <unk> world for all <unk> ...

I figured , take a guess , help a charity , free boat !
Why would a charity give away a free boat ? !
I don &apos;t know ! <unk> ?
Ugh !
Well , just buy the damn boat !
Phoebe , don &apos;t you think you &apos;ve had enough to drink ?
I &apos;m just helping the kids !
How is you drinking helping the kids ?
Because the more I drink , the less there is for the kids to drink .
Mr. Tribbiani .
Oh hi !
Your generous <unk> brings us a big step closer to building the <unk> center .
Just out of curiosity , how-how much is that boat worth ?
I think it was <unk> at <unk>
Hey , I was pretty close . Uhh , so bad news . Umm , I can &apos;t buy the boat , I don &apos;t have any money .
Joey ! Joey , good one !
That &apos;s good . Very good !
So uh listen , I think I &apos;m gonna take off now .
Hey ! You ... can &apos;t ... leave Joey ! You agreed to buy that boat , all right ? ! That is a contract ! And plus if you leave , my boss is gonna kill me !
Well , what am I gonna do Rach ? ! I don &apos;t have that kind of money !
I know . Okay . Okay . Okay . All right . All right , this is what we &apos;re gonna do , we are gonna go to the next highest <unk> , and we are just gonna let them buy it , and then you &apos;re just gonna pay the difference .
Okay .
Okay .
Look , I don &apos;t know why the kids need a <unk> center anyway ! Y &apos;know ? They should just watch TV after school like I did and I turned out fine !
Not great .
And so , we &apos;re hiding in the bathroom .
And-and then I sneak out and before Monica can her parents come in .
So I hide in the shower and the next thing you know they &apos;re going at it right on the bathroom floor .
Oh my God !
I got a good one , I got a good one ! I once walked in on both my parents making love to the same guy .
It &apos;s so great seeing you guys again . I &apos;d like to make a toast . Uh , as a poet once said , &quot; In the <unk> of friendship , let there be <unk> and sharing of <unk> for in the due of little things the heart finds it &apos;s morning and is <unk> . &quot;
Ohh .
What ? !
Oh my God , you guys ! !
Before you say anything , have we got a story for you ! Guess who we bumped into at dinner !
Who ?
Richard !
What ? <unk> ! Ohh . Oh that &apos;s right that &apos;s right . That &apos;s Richard &apos;s favorite place too .
Oh you knew that . Good !
I thought you were going out with Elizabeth .
Yeah , I was but uh , she was a little busy with a water <unk> fight .
Oh Ross , sometimes <unk> have <unk> they just can &apos;t get out of !
Y &apos;know , maybe she is too young for me . Y &apos;know , when I was over there and she was running around with her friends , I felt like I was a <unk> . I finally started to see what you guys were talking about . I don &apos;t know what to do .
Why don &apos;t you just <unk> out the good stuff about the relationship against the bad stuff . I mean that &apos;s what I did when I first <unk> stuff .
Okay umm , bad stuff . Well , I &apos;m-I &apos;m 12 years older than she is .
If the school finds out you &apos;re fired .
Hmm .
She &apos;s leaving for three months .
For camp !
Okay , good stuff . Umm , well she &apos;s-she &apos;s sweet and pretty and ...
Look Ross , the only question you need to ask is , &quot; Do you see a future ? &quot; I mean like do you see yourself marrying her ? Oh my God ! You did it already ! You married her , didn &apos;t you ? !
No ! No ! I ... didn &apos;t do that . It &apos;s just ... Okay , honestly no . I don &apos;t , I don &apos;t see a big future with her .
Okay well I think ... that &apos;s your answer .
I &apos;ve got to talk to her . Ugh , I hate this part .
Hey , you have to forget about Elizabeth . I mean if you &apos;re not careful you may not get married at all this year !
Rach ! Rachel ! Okay , the next highest <unk> is at table one .
Oh great !
Oh and uh the guy who got the Paris trip is at table four .

Well , a <unk> reader , a <unk> , a hand doctor ...

Good one ! Yeah .
This is terrible . What am I going to do ?
Look , she only <unk> something okay ? She doesn &apos;t know for sure , so just throw her off the track .
That &apos;s right , I can throw her off . I can make her think marriage is the last thing on my mind .
Yeah ! Yeah ! <unk> her that-that you &apos;re scared of commitment ! <unk> her that you &apos;re a little <unk> !
I can do that , I &apos;ve had 30 years of practice .
Hey , being you is finally gonna pay off !
I had to go all the way to the <unk> because some idiot keeps stuffing the trash chute with pizza boxes !
That guy &apos;s still doing that ? !
Hey ! Oh my God you &apos;re here , let me see your hand ! !
No , you &apos;re too late ! ! ! She already took out the trash ! ! !
Wow ! I have never had such a healthy break-up ! She was such a grown-up about it ! She didn &apos;t seem too immature for me ! Did I just make a huge mistake ?
Ross ! Wait !
Elizabeth , thank God ! I was just thinking about ...
You suck ! !
What ? !
Okay , break-up &apos;s still on !
Okay , okay , here she comes ! How do I look ? Do I look like a guy who doesn &apos;t want to get married ?
Yeah ! And also , a little like a French guy . I never noticed that before .
Hi guys !
Hey !
Hey !
What are you up too ?
Oh , just hanging out , talkin &apos; about uh , <unk> . Yeah , we saw this really interesting <unk> about marriage and how totally <unk> it is and how its just a way for the government to keep <unk> on you .
Yeah , Big <unk> .
Well that &apos;s a little crazy . Although I am y &apos;know glad to hear that you &apos;re <unk> out on what you look at on the <unk> .
Yeah , well ... Y &apos;know , it just got me thinking though , why would anybody ever want to get married huh ?
Why ? ! To celebrate your relationship ! To <unk> your commitment ! To declare your love for one another to the world !
Eh ...
Okay well that &apos;s good to know .
The Mr. Bowmont &apos;s here ! ! !
Hey Monica , there &apos;s a customer who wants to complement the chef , should I let him in ?
Sure , I love this part !
Come on in .
Hi !
Richard !
Actually , I &apos;m not here to complement the chef .
Ohh ... Oh , that &apos;s okay I hate when people come back to complement the chef . Like I have nothing better to do ! So what &apos;s up ?
Well , it was great seeing you the other night .
Oh , good to see you too . Did you come down here to tell me that ?
No ! I came here to tell you something else . I came here to tell you I still love you .
What <unk> did <unk> ? !
I still love you . And I know I probably shouldn &apos;t even be here telling you this , I mean you &apos;re with Chandler a guy I really like , and if you say he &apos;s straight I &apos;ll believe you ! After seeing ya the other night I knew if I didn &apos;t tell ya I &apos;d <unk> it for the rest of my life . <unk> you go was the stupidest thing I ever did .
Y &apos;know you &apos;re really not supposed to be back here !
Well yeah , I &apos;m sorry . I know this is the wrong time and the wrong place but I had to tell ya ! I wanna spend my life with you . I wanna marry you . I wanna have kids with you .
Oh God ... Why don &apos;t they put chairs back here ? !
I know this is crazy but am I too late ?
What the ... Yes you &apos;re too late ! Where was all this three years ago ? !
Well I know I was an idiot ! And I tried to forget you , I really did ! Y &apos;know after we had lunch last year I spent six months in <unk> trying to get you out of my head !
What were you doing in <unk> ?
<unk> with blind kids .
Ohhh ! What are you doing to me ? ! Oh look , I-I ... I &apos;m sorry but umm , <unk> is not going to happen .
Okay that &apos;s fine , I &apos;ll walk away . And I &apos;ll never bother you again , but only if you tell me Chandler &apos;s willing to give you everything I am .
Well he is ! Yeah , I mean marriage is all he talks about ! My <unk> , in fact , I &apos;m the one that &apos;s making him wait !
You are ?
Yeah !
Why ?
Why ? Because of the government .
Isn &apos;t it incredible ? ! Monica and Chandler , gettin &apos; married .
I know , they &apos;re gonna be so happy together .
Ohh ... I mean two best friends falling in love , how often does that happen ?
Not that often !
No ! I &apos;m so happy for them !
Me too ! So happy for them !
I &apos;m so happy and not at all jealous .
Oh no ! No God , definitely not jealous !
I mean I &apos;m probably 98 % happy , maybe 2 % jealous . And I mean what &apos;s 2 % ? That &apos;s nothing .
Totally . I &apos;m like 90 / 10 .
Yeah me too .
Hey uh , have you guys scene Chandler ?
<unk> , but y &apos;know who did stop in here looking for ya , <unk> .
So that marriage stuff that you were saying yesterday , you don &apos;t really believe that do you ?
Sure I do . In fact , I think the whole concept of marriage is <unk> . I mean look at pigs . Let &apos;s take a second here and look at pigs . Okay pigs don &apos;t mate for life . I mean a pig can have like a hundred sexual partners in a lifetime , and that &apos;s just an <unk> pig not even a pig that &apos;s good at sports !
Yeah , but that &apos;s pigs not people !
If marriage worked , I &apos;d be all for it . But do you know what the divorce rate in this country is ? 97 % .
Wait a minute . Are you honestly telling me that-that you may never want to get married ?
Well , never say never but y &apos;know probably uh yeah , never .
Oh my God ! <unk> what are we even doing ? ! What is this ? !
Whoa ! Whoa ! Whoa ! What is all this pressure ? ! Is this some new kind of <unk> ? Why don &apos;t you put down your copy of &apos; The Rules &apos; huh <unk> ? !
Y &apos;know what ? ! I gotta go ! Ugh !
It &apos;s okay , I got a plan .
We &apos;re gonna find love !
Definitely !
Yeah , I &apos;m pretty confident about that . That &apos;s what makes it so easy for me to be 80 % happy for Monica and Chandler ! It would be nice to have a little guarantee though .
What do you mean ?
Well y &apos;know , some people make <unk> with a friend , like if neither of them are married by the time they &apos;re 40 , they marry each other .
You mean a backup ?
Exactly !
Yeah , yeah I got that .
You do ?
Hm-mmm .
Who ?
Joey .
Joey ? !
Yeah !
Are you serious ? !
Yeah , I locked him years ago !
Wh ... So ... If neither of you are married by the time you &apos;re 40 , you &apos;re gonna marry Joey .
Yep , we <unk> on it . Yeah but believe me that is not how he wanted to <unk> the deal .
Oh , seriously ?
Ohh , yeah . I think his exact words were ...
<unk> .
Well hey , it &apos;s just a backup .
Yeah .
Hey Monica !
Have you seen Rachel ? Or a mirror ?
This is for my boat , pretty cool huh ?
Yeah , it &apos;s great .
Whoa-whoa , what &apos;s the matter ? ! Talk to the captain !
I &apos;m just having one of those days where you realize you &apos;re in a <unk> relationship !
Chandler giving you a hard time huh ?
It &apos;s not like I want to get married tomorrow ! It &apos;s just that I-I &apos;d like to believe that I &apos;m in a relationship that &apos;s actually going somewhere , that I &apos;m not just wasting my time !
Well , you know Chandler .
No I don &apos;t know Chandler ! Not anymore ! It &apos;s like it &apos;s like something &apos;s changed .
Maybe you changed ?
I didn &apos;t change !
Maybe that &apos;s the problem .
What ? !
Chandler is a complex fellow , one who is unlikely to take a wife .
Is that some kind of boat talk ?
I don &apos;t know ! I haven &apos;t totally decided how to talk on my boat yet .
What does he think ? Does he think I &apos;m just gonna wait around for nothing ?
Monica face it , Chandler is against marriage . And-and always will be !
Well there &apos;s some people who do want to marry me .
There are ?
Yeah ! Richard !
<unk> said he wants to marry you ? ! And-and Chandler &apos;s tellin &apos; ya how much he hates marriage ? !
That &apos;s right .
Chandler loves marriage ! !
You just told me that he hates marriage ! That-that he &apos;s a-a complex fellow who &apos;s unlikely to take a wife ! That-that he &apos;s against marriage and always will be !
You got that from what I said ? !
When the <unk> period ended , the dinosaurs were gone .
What happened you guys ?
Rach !
Hey you !
Hey , come on in .
Oh thank you . Hey y &apos;know , I &apos;m so sorry to hear about you and Elizabeth .
Oh , thanks . Yeah , I really thought we &apos;d be able to make it work , but uh , I guess it just wasn &apos;t meant to be .
Yeah , love . It &apos;s a tricky business isn &apos;t it ?
I guess so .
So what do you say we make a <unk> ? If you and I are both single by the time we &apos;re 40 , we get married . I mean , we know each other , we like each other , and we &apos;ve-we &apos;ve already slept together so y &apos;know there &apos;ll be no <unk> there ! You know what I mean ? No like , &quot; What &apos;s that ? ! &quot;
Right . Ohh ! You-you want me to be your backup .
Exactly .
Ohh , yeah I already have one .
What ? Who ?
Phoebe .
Phoebe ? ! Wait <unk> she just , she said that Joey was her backup .
Ohh , I don &apos;t think so .
Ross ! I just had a conversation with her , and she said that she and Joey made a deal !
That &apos;s impossible ! I mean we have had a deal for years ! <unk> <unk> on it , although believe me she wanted to do a lot more than that .
Where the hell have you been ? !
I was making a coconut phone with the professor .
Richard told Monica he wants to marry her !
What ? !
Yeah ! Yeah , I &apos;ve been trying to find ya to tell to stop messing with her and maybe I would have if these damn boat shoes wouldn &apos;t keep flying off !
<unk> my God !
I know ! They suck ! !
He &apos;s not supposed to ask my girlfriend to marry him ! I &apos;m supposed to do that !
I know !
Well what ... Y &apos;know what I &apos;m gonna do ? I &apos;m gonna go over there ; I &apos;m gonna kick his ass ! Will you help me ? !
Look , Chandler I don &apos;t think us getting our <unk> kicked is a solution . Okay ? Just go and find Monica !
You &apos;re right .
Yeah !
Okay . I &apos;m gonna get the ring ! I &apos;m gonna get the ring ! I &apos;m gonna go find her and I &apos;m just going to propose !
Okay .
Okay great .
<unk> !
What ? !
Let me know about that coconut phone , it might great for the boat .
Hi .
Hi .
I don &apos;t know why I &apos;m here .
I didn &apos;t ask . You wanna come in ?
I don &apos;t know .
Oh , okay . Well , I &apos;ll just leave the door open and go sit on the couch .
Chandler is such an idiot !
<unk> ?
Yeah , I &apos;ll have a <unk> ...
... on the rocks with a <unk> ? I remember .
Still smoking cigars ?
Uh , no ! No ! That &apos;s ... art ! If it bothers you I can put my art out .
No that &apos;s , that &apos;s okay .
So Monica let me ask you a question . Y &apos;know , since we broke up do you ever , think about me ?
Uh yeah , I-I actually I thought about you a couple months ago .
Oh really ?
Yeah but it was because I-I had an eye exam and I don &apos;t like my new eye doctor .
Who is it ?
<unk> <unk> ?
Yeah he &apos;s no good . Do you ever think about me in a <unk> doctor way ?
No .
Ahh .
But getting over was the hardest thing that I &apos;ve ever had to do . And I never let myself think about you .
Phoebe ! You picked Joey and Ross ? ! You can not have two <unk> !
Of course I can ! It &apos;s just good sense to backup your backup ! Look , I &apos;ve already lost Chandler !
What ? !
Hey !
Hey !
Phoebe ! We &apos;re both your backup ? !
Phoebe , how could you do this to me ? !
I don <unk> I don &apos;t know what you &apos;re <unk> about now ? You were both aware of the situation !
No we weren &apos;t !
I was not !
Okay , this kind of back talk is not gonna fly when we &apos;re married !
Phoebe you can &apos;t have both of them ! You have to pick one !
Pick me ! !
No ! Pick me ! I don &apos;t want to end up an old maid !
All right well let &apos;s see , Ross is a good father , but Joey has a <unk> is hard !
This is crazy ! Hey look , I wanna switch to Rachel !
Ooh , I wanna switch to Rachel too !
No wait ! <unk> wait ! You guys ! Wait you guys ! Don &apos;t make any <unk> decisions , okay ? Just remember my promise , when we get married , three times a week .
Oh God , Phoebe !
I &apos;m talking about massages .
Oh .
Okay , y &apos;know what ? ! I know-I know how to settle this ! All right here , this is what we &apos;re gonna do ! I &apos;m gonna write Joey on one napkin and I &apos;m gonna right Ross on the other napkin and we are going to pick one ! And that person is going to be our backup ! Okay ?

Excuse me ?
Oh ! Him .
Oh . Whew !
I missed this apartment ! Now , this is a grown-up &apos;s apartment ! Y &apos;know , I-I should be with a grown-up , do you know what I mean ? !
Yeah ! You &apos;re saying , you need to be with someone more mature . Maybe someone with , a license to practice medicine . Or a mustache .
Y &apos;know , let &apos;s face it , I &apos;m not a kid anymore ! I-I need to be with someone who-who wants the same things that I do ! I mean coming to my place of work and telling me that you love me , I want that ! <unk> about pig sex over lunch , I don &apos;t want that !
I think that &apos;s fair .
Fair ? Please don &apos;t even talk to me about fair ! Fair would &apos;ve been you wanting to marry me back then ! Or fair would &apos;ve been Chandler wanting to marry me now ! Believe me , nothing about this is fair ! Nothing ! Nothing ! Nothing ! Nothing ! Nothing ! Nothing ! Nothing ! Nothing ! Nothing ! Nothing !
It &apos;s okay ! Shh ! Hey . Hey . Shhhh .
Nothing . I don &apos;t <unk> . I don &apos;t know . Umm ...

Yeah , I understand . Take as much time as you want . Ten , even twenty minutes if you need it . I &apos;ll be here . Not smoking .

Okay , she was here , but she left .
Well where did she go ?
Well she said she had to think things over .
Oh my God , I can &apos;t believe this ! Y &apos;know , I thought ... I thought you were a good guy .
Oh , hey look nothing happened .
Nothing happened ? Nothing ? So you didn &apos;t tell my girlfriend that you love her ?
Well all right , one thing happened ?
Y &apos;know what ? I can &apos;t believe this ! Do you know what you did ? My girlfriend is out there thinking things over ! You made my girlfriend think ! !
Well I &apos;m sorry .
And what does she have to think about ? I love her !
Well , apparently I &apos;m willing to offer her things that you are not .
But I am willing to offer her all those things . This was just a plan , y &apos;know ? A way to throw her off course so that when I offered her all these things , she &apos;d be surprised !
Well if it helps , it worked very well .
It was working until you showed up , you big tree ! I mean , this isn &apos;t fair . You had your chance with her ! You had your chance and you blew it ! And this is my chance and I am not going to blow it because we are meant for each other ! And this is all just been one stupid mistake ! I was gonna propose tonight .
You were gonna propose ?
Yeah I even got a ring . Did you get a ring ?
No I don &apos;t have a ring ! You go get her Chandler . And can I give you a piece of advice ? If you do get her , don &apos;t let her go . Trust me .
Y &apos;know Richard ... you are a good guy .
I know . I hate that !
Dude !
I can &apos;t talk to you now , I gotta find Monica !
She &apos;s gone .
What ?
She &apos;s gone . She had a bag and she left .
What are you talking about ?
She was all crying . She-she said you guys want different things , and that and that she needed time to think .
Well why didn &apos;t you stop her ? ! Why didn &apos;t you just tell her it was a plan ? !
I-I did ! I told her everything , Chandler ! But she wouldn &apos;t believe me .
Well where ... Where did she go ?
To her parent &apos;s I think and she said you shouldn &apos;t call her . But if I were you I would .
I can &apos;t believe I ruined this .
I am so sorry man .
You wanted it to be a surprise .
Oh my God .
Chandler ... In all my life ... I never thought I would be so lucky . As to ... fall in love with my best ... my best ... There &apos;s a reason why girls don &apos;t do this !
Okay ! Okay ! Okay ! Oh God , I thought ... Wait a minute , I-I can do this . I thought that it <unk> what I said or where I said it . Then I realized the only thing that matters is that you , you make me <unk> than I ever thought I could be . And if you &apos;ll let me , I will spend the rest of my life trying to make you feel the same way . Monica , will you marry me ?
Yes .
I knew you were <unk> to take a wife !
Can we come it yet ? ! We &apos;re dying out here !
Come in ! Come in ! We &apos;re engaged ! ! !
Ohhh , this is the least jealous I &apos;ve ever been !
Oh no wait no , this is wrong ! Ross isn &apos;t here !

We found your test in the trash , if you &apos;re not <unk> &apos;s because I am .
What ? ! What are you talking about ?
What are you talking about ?
Yes , I ... I am with child . And I didn &apos;t want to say anything because it &apos;s your day ; I didn &apos;t want to steal your thunder .
Wait a minute ! So you told people I was pregnant ? ! Does this look like a conversation that I want to remember ? !
Who &apos;s the father ?
Yeah !
I can &apos;t say .
Why ? !
Why not ?
I can &apos;t say because he &apos;s famous .
Oh my God , who is it ? !
Phoebe , come on , you have to tell us .
Okay , okay . It &apos;s James Brolin . James Brolin is the father of my baby .
As in Barbara <unk> &apos;s husband James Brolin ?

How about just the bridemaids ?
Y &apos;know I am the groom right ? I was told it was kinda big deal .
It is .
For you .

Hi .

Oh it &apos;s been going on way to long now . Y &apos;know , I mean the first time he said it we were just <unk> each other in the hallway , so I didn &apos;t say anything . And then the next time he said , &quot; Hey Toby , do you want a donut ? &quot; And I-I wanted a donut . And now it &apos;s five years later , the donut &apos;s gone and I &apos;m still Toby .
Five years ? ! Chandler you have to tell him !
No ! That would be so awkward ! <unk> , we work in different <unk> . He &apos;s on the sixth floor y &apos;know ? So he calls me Toby once in a while . What &apos;s the big deal ? It could be worse , it &apos;s not like he &apos;s calling me Muriel .

Shh ! It is a family name !
Chandler Muriel Bing . Boy , your parents never gave you a chance did they ?
Drake , I &apos;ve discovered the reason for all your <unk> and memory loss .
What is it ?
Apparently your brain <unk> was not entirely successful . It seems your body is rejecting Jessica &apos;s brain .
Is it serious ?
Not if we <unk> tissue from the original host body , <unk> <unk> , and introduce them into your system , which could stop it from rejecting the brain .
Well that sounds simple enough , let &apos;s just do that .
We would , but when we went to <unk> Jessica &apos;s body , it was gone .
Cut ! Very nice people !
Okay , let me just get changed and we can go to dinner .
Well don <unk> happened to Jessica &apos;s body ? !

Although I do know that your uh , your favorite ice cream <unk> is butter <unk> . And uh , and that your-your dog &apos;s name is <unk> . Well look at that , I &apos;m just <unk> your arm .

Ooh Monica !
Hi !
Oh my God ! I had the best time with Tim last night . He is so sweet ! Oh , I can &apos;t wait to get <unk> him .
I ... I have to fire him .
But why ? !
Because he &apos;s terrible ! Okay , he &apos;s slow , he burns things , last night he lit my pastry chef on fire !
Well maybe he was just nervous , y &apos;know you can be very <unk> . And besides I &apos;ve met your pastry chef and she can stand to be taken down a <unk> or two .
Well , now she has no <unk> , mission <unk> .
But Monica , he loves his job so much ! Can you just give him another chance ? Please ?
All right , but if-if he lights someone else on fire he is out of there !
That &apos;s fair ! Thank you so much . Thanks . Oops , it looks like when he got the pastry chef he got you a little bit too .
I paid to have this done .
Love it !
Hey !
Hi !
Oh you know uh Kash , really liked you the other day . He said he thought you were charming .
I thought I was a complete idiot .
Hey , I &apos;m with you . He even asked me if I thought you &apos;d go out with him .
Oh ! Oh , I think I &apos;m gonna throw up a little bit . What did you say ?
I said no .
What ? !
What ? I ... I just figured since you &apos;re pregnant you &apos;re not gonna be seeing people .
Okay Joey , first of all Kash Ford is not people . Second of all , what did he say when you told him I was pregnant ?
I didn &apos;t tell him . I didn &apos;t know if you were telling people . This is back when I thought Kash was still people .
Good-good , don &apos;t tell him . Don &apos;t tell him . Just have him call me okay ?
Rach look , I really don &apos;t think that &apos;s such a great ...
Okay , you go do it ! I &apos;ll come back to that set ! I &apos;ll meet more actors ! I &apos;ll meet &apos; em all !
Hey Bob .
Hey ! How &apos;s my pal Toby doing today ?
If I see him , I &apos;ll ask .
Toby !
Hey-hey ! Bing ? Was that Bob from six you were just talking too ?
Yeah !
Oh then you know each other .
We &apos;re on a <unk> name <unk> .
What do you think of adding him to our team ?
Bob ? Ooh , working here with us ? <unk> ? Yeah , I don &apos;t know if he has what it takes .
Really ? They love him down on six .
But this is eleven . It &apos;s almost twice as hard up here .
Okay , I hear you loud and clear . Bob will stay put .
I think it &apos;s best sir .
But we really do need to find someone up here . The work is starting to <unk> up . I &apos;ve got a <unk> of <unk> on my desk this high .
Y &apos;know what you should do , just toss &apos; em in the <unk> and claim you never got &apos; em .
That &apos;s a good one .
What does a guy have to do to be taken seriously around here ? !
Hey !
Hey . Okay , I gave him another chance , but Tim has got to go !
But ...
No ! No-no ! He is totally <unk> . I called the chef who <unk> him to me . He said , &quot; Ha-ha ! Gotcha ! &quot;
Okay . Okay , but you can &apos;t fire him today .
Why not ? !
Because I &apos;m dumping him today .
What ? ! You said he was sweet !
He is sweet . He &apos;s too sweet . He calls me all the time . &quot; So <unk> you get home from work okay ? &quot; &quot; Did-did you get out of the shower okay ? &quot;
Just don &apos;t pick up your phone .
Then he comes over ! &quot; I &apos;m so worried about you . &quot; Uck ! Be a man !
What ? So now I &apos;m not allowed to fire him ?
You can &apos;t fire him and dump him the same day , he &apos;ll kill himself .
Okay well then , I &apos;ll fire him today and you go out with him for another week .
Are you kidding ? ! Another week with that <unk> , I &apos;ll kill myself !
Okay well , then we &apos;ll both do it today and he &apos;ll just have to deal with it !
Okay . But the question is who &apos;s gonna go first . &apos; Cause whoever goes second is the bitch .
What do you mean ?
Come on ! The boss that <unk> a guy that &apos;s just been dumped , bitch ! And the woman who <unk> a guy that &apos;s just been fired , blond bitch !
I wanted to do this days ago so I think I should go first .
All right , that makes sense . Ugh . <unk> you I &apos;m going first !
Hey Toby , you got a sec ?
Sure , what &apos;s up ?
I just had a meeting , I was actually hoping to get <unk> up here , but I just found out its not gonna happen . Apparently somebody thinks I &apos;m not <unk> floor material . Say uh , who the hell is this Chandler ?
Hey , what do you think is a better excuse for why I &apos;m not drinking on this date tonight . &quot; Umm , I &apos;m a <unk> <unk> . I &apos;m a <unk> , &quot; or &quot; I got so hammered last night I &apos;m still a little drunk ? &quot;

Joey , I &apos;m not worried about her ! I &apos;m worried about my baby ! Whoever she dates my baby dates ! Now-now where is this actor taking them ?
Hey ! I &apos;m an actor too ! I &apos;m not sure . I think they &apos;re taking the ferry out to some Italian place on Staten Island .
A ferry ? My baby is going on a ferry ? Do you have any idea how dangerous those are ? !

It &apos;s just I always thought when I had another kid it would be different . Now I-I love Ben , but every time I have to drop him off at Carol and Susan &apos;s , it &apos;s <unk> breaks my heart a little . I mean I &apos;ve always had this picture of me and my next wife in bed on Sunday and , my kid comes running in and <unk> up onto the bed . And we all read the paper together . Y &apos;know ? Maybe fight over the science <unk> .
That &apos;s a nice picture . Maybe you can still have that !
No ! No I can &apos;t . I mean Rachel &apos;s out with some guy . My baby went with her . If anything that picture keeps moving further away .
Hey , can I ask you something ? In this , in this picture of you and your wife , is your wife Rachel ?
It used to be . Now she doesn &apos;t really have a face . <unk> &apos; body though .
Good call . Yeah . But , the face Ross , the face isn &apos;t Rachel .
No but ahh ! How much easier would it be if it were ?
I know , but I don &apos;t think that &apos;s what she wants .
No , it &apos;s not what I want either . I mean I-I can &apos;t force myself to fall in love with her again now .
That &apos;s okay Ross maybe you need a new picture . Okay ? It &apos;s not gonna be what you thought , but no matter what there &apos;s gonna be a brand new little baby , your baby . Who cares what the picture looks like ?
Yeah .
Hey , I tell you what . Let &apos;s you and me go out and have some fun . Huh ? Whatever you want . Come on !

So <unk> Joey know you &apos;re moving ?
Well , I haven &apos;t discussed it with him yet , but I know he &apos;s gonna be relieved . Last week , he brought this girl over and I started talking to her about morning sickness and then I showed her pictures from my pregnancy book .
That &apos;s not really porn .
Not so much .
Hey , y &apos;know what and if you &apos;re looking for a place ? I just heard in the elevator this morning that a woman in my building died .
Oh my God ! Was she old ? Does she have a view ?
Well I don &apos;t know , but how-how great would that be huh ? You living in my building . I could help take care of the baby . I can come over whenever I want . With your <unk> .

She didn &apos;t pass .

My mother &apos;s still alive .
Oh , thank God !
It looked like we were gonna lose her this morning , but she &apos;s a tough old bird .
Ahh .
Are you close with her ?
Of course ! Uh yeah , she and I would talk all the time in-in the laundry room .
You <unk> Dutch ? <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> Van <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .

Okay .
See ? I told you .
She stole my jeans !
What ?
I have been looking for them all week and she is wearing them !
So she stole your pants and then she came back and wore them in front of you ?
Don &apos;t you see ? It &apos;s the perfect crime !
She must &apos;ve been planning this for years !
I will prove it to you ! Okay ? About a week ago I was wearing those jeans and I dropped a pen in my lap and it left an ink stain on the crotch . Now when she comes back I will find it and show you that stain !
Honey , isn &apos;t it possible that the company that sold the jeans made more than just the one pair ?
I guess .
So , shouldn &apos;t we go give her the benefit of the doubt before we go ... <unk> around her crotch ?
Fine . I &apos;m just glad I didn &apos;t give her my secret ingredient .
Out of curiosity , what is your secret ingredient ?
Yeah !
Hi !
Come in , I &apos;m so glad you &apos;re here .
Yeah , me too . Not in the <unk> angry way you are though .
Sorry , I just saw Ursula . I had to give the engagement ring back .
Oh .
Just seeing her brought it all back . All the lies , the way she used me . I just ... I got so angry just looking at her ...... face .
Yeah . Yeah .
I &apos;m sorry . I just ... when I look at you I see her . When I see her I get a little bit angry .
Maybe this is too weird .
No wait ! There &apos;s only a problem when I look at you . Oh I got it ! I got it .
No don &apos;t tear out your eyes ! !
I was just , I was just gonna take out my <unk> .
Oh , yeah try that . So , is that better ?
Not really . You ... you &apos;re <unk> , but you still look like Ursula . You &apos;re <unk> . Okay wait . Maybe ... If <unk> I just don &apos;t look at you for a while . See ? It ... it works . I &apos;m not , I &apos;m not angry at all anymore ! This is a great date !
Look Eric , turn around . Look , I like you , but it shouldn &apos;t be this hard . Y &apos;know ? This is our first date y &apos;know ? First dates are supposed to be about excitement and <unk> and &apos; Ooh , he just touched my hand , did he mean to touch my hand ? &apos; and y &apos;know first kisses and ...... second kisses .

To tape the game ? You do this every time Ross , you &apos;re not gonna be on TV !
No-no , I-I have to see if this apartment became available .
Oh , you &apos;re switching apartments ?
It &apos;s not for me , it &apos;s for Rachel .
But Rachel has an apartment .
Yeah , but when the baby comes she &apos;s gonna want to move .
She is ?
Yeah , you didn &apos;t expect her to live there with a baby did you ?
I guess I didn &apos;t really think about it .
Ezel ! Hey Gunther ! You &apos;re an <unk> !

Damnit !
Nice jeans !
Oh thanks ! I like your top .
Oh . You &apos;re not gettin &apos; it .

Hello .
What &apos;s going on ? !
I &apos;m sorry . I &apos;ve never had a maid before , is this not okay ?
Hey !
Hey !
How was the game ?
Oh , okay . I ... I ate way too much .
Oh .
Ooh . So umm , I was talkin &apos; to Ross and he said you were looking for a new place .
Oh yeah ! <unk> across the street if certain Dutch people would just let go .
I was kinda hoping you &apos;d stay .
Oh but Joey , I have to go . There &apos;s no room for a baby here .
No room ? It &apos;s a baby . It &apos;s like this big . Y &apos;know , I mean you-you could you could put it over here . <unk> we could put it right here . Aw , it &apos;s cute , right ? Or-or we could put it over here . You wouldn &apos;t even notice it . Where &apos;s the baby ?
Honey , it &apos;s not just a matter of where you put it . I mean a baby changes everything . They cry all the time . I mean imagine bringing home some girl and trying to score when there &apos;s a screaming baby around .
I could use a challenge ! It &apos;s getting pretty easy .
Honey , it &apos;s so sweet that you want me to stay , but I-I can &apos;t do that to you . I mean it would <unk> your entire life .
I love living with you so much . I just wish things didn &apos;t have to change .
I know .
Y &apos;know I blame Ross for this .
I do too a little bit .
I &apos;m gonna miss you , you &apos;re the <unk> roommate I ever had .
Ooh , oh no ! I have to go ! I have a massage appointment .
Oh no , stay here we &apos;ll keep doing this . I &apos;ll pay you .
No , I got in trouble for that before . I &apos;ll see you later .
Absolutely . I love the way you kiss .
Really ? That &apos;s the thing I &apos;m worse at ! You &apos;ll see .
Hi !
Hey ! Umm , I think Brenda needs a raise .
How come ?
Because I put my head between her legs .
To see her pants ?
They &apos;re my pants !
Are you sure ? Did you see the stain ?
No ! I was just getting into position and then everything went dark .
God ! She is not stealing from us ! Okay , will you let this go ?
Fine . She &apos;s wearing my bra !
Oh dear God !
My pink <unk> bra ! I recognize the <unk> !
And yet you don &apos;t recognize that you &apos;re crazy .
Here &apos;s the plan ! Okay ? I &apos;m going to leave you get a look at Brenda &apos;s bra !
Here &apos;s another plan ... No !
I would do it but she thinks I &apos;m attracted to her !
Why ?
Did you not hear where my head was ? Come on ! Come on we &apos;re a team ! We &apos;re in this together !
I fear a <unk> will see it the same way !
Do this for me ! Come on , I catch you looking at woman &apos;s breasts all the time !
You see that ?
Do you see this ?
All right . Yes . Okay . I get your point . But if it &apos;s not your bra will you just let the woman clean the apartment ? !
Yes ! Absolutely . Okay ? Look , you &apos;ll know it &apos;s mine because on the right cup , the <unk> part , there &apos;s a very <unk> rip .
You need new clothes .
Hi . How is she ?
It &apos;s not looking good .
Oh . Oh . Well I uh , I brought her some <unk> .
That &apos;s so sweet . Would you like to come in and say good-bye ? I &apos;m sure it would mean a lot to her .
Oh I don &apos;t know that it would .
Well , her memory is pretty much gone .
All right then .
Hey !
Welcome back !
Hey ! Can we pick up where we left off ?
I don &apos;t know , I &apos;m still pretty tired out from this afternoon .
Why ?
Uh , the sex .
What sex ?
Our sex .
We didn &apos;t have sex .
Well if I didn &apos;t have sex with you , I had sex with someone that looked an awful lot like ...
Ew ! Ew ! Ew ! Ew ! Ew ! Ew !
Oh no ! Oh no ! Oh no ! Oh no ! No ! No ! No !
You-you ... you had sex with Ursula ? !
Uh , a little bit . <unk> walked in and I thought she was you and I kissed her and ...
You didn &apos;t notice she was wearing different clothes ? !
Well I was just so excited to see you .
Oh . Ew ! Ew ! Ew ! Ugh ! Y &apos;know what ? This is too weird .
No-no it &apos;s not ! I don &apos;t want to lose you ! It &apos;s-it &apos;s like I was saying to Ursula when I was making love to her and I thought she was <unk> it is too weird .
So I guess this is it .
Yeah . Maybe it &apos;s for the best . You smell just like her .
Yeah , so do you .
What are you doing ?
I &apos;m <unk> . This is where I <unk> .
Okay . ( <unk> over and <unk> up the pillows on the couch .

You do ?
Look , I know it must be hard that your wife is a lesbian , but it &apos;s wrong . You &apos;re married .
I totally understand . Can I just see your bra ?
Hi !
Where did you get those jeans ? !
You gave them to me !
No I didn &apos;t !
All right , I took them . But I figured it would be okay because you got a big ink stain on the crotch .
Oh no ! Did you take my bra too ? !
What bra ?
The pink one with the flowers ? !
You mean the one that you &apos;re wearing ?
I quit !
Sounds about right .
What is this ?
Hey ! Uh , this is just to give you an idea . Okay well , we can put <unk> here , so that the baby has privacy , and-and-and maybe a <unk> over the crib . And <unk> look ! Here &apos;s a baby <unk> , which until the baby comes we can use as <unk> . Huh ?
You &apos;re so sweet . Oh my God ! And you gave the baby <unk> !
<unk> .... That-that-that &apos;s really just to show where the baby would go . Y &apos;know why don &apos;t I hold on to him so that there &apos;s no <unk> ?
But Joey the baby is going to be crying , it &apos;s going to be loud .
I &apos;m loud !
It &apos;s gonna be up all night !
I &apos;m up all night !
It &apos;s gonna <unk> !
Hello !
What about all the women you want to bring home ?
Look , if I &apos;m bringing home a woman who can &apos;t stand being around a baby , then maybe I don &apos;t want to be with that woman ! Or maybe we &apos;ll just do it in the bathroom of the club !
Joey , are you sure ?
Yeah ! All <unk> , I know sometimes it &apos;ll be hard , okay ? But , it &apos;ll also be really ... really great . Please Rachel ! I-I-I really want you to stay .

Look , I appreciate it , but uh , it &apos;s a little creepy . Y &apos;know ? I &apos;m not a bachelor anymore .

What ? !
Oh but not that way . I mean ... I mean I &apos;m not in love with her . I love her like a , like a friend .

I &apos;m sorry . Dr. Green , Mona . Mona , Dr. Green .
I can &apos;t believe there is a naked hooker in there !
Wait ! Wait ! Maybe she &apos;s a hooker and a stripper , but she got <unk> about what she &apos;s supposed to do .
Could be . I mean technically she did strip , we just , we just missed it . Ma &apos;am , are you also a stripper ?
Uh , no . But I could pretend to strip , but that &apos;s gonna cost extra . Okay , here &apos;s the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ...
Maybe Monica &apos;s playing a joke on ya . Y &apos;know ? Getting her own husband a hooker , that &apos;s pretty funny .
That is funny , maybe for my birthday she &apos;ll <unk> someone .
I bet Ross was in on it too . I mean he was <unk> busy .
Do you mind if I smoke in here ?
Oh actually , I &apos;d rather you ... Yeah , go ahead . We &apos;re gonna have to burn that room down anyway .
How could you have kept all of this from me ?
I was going to tell you , but ...
But what ? ! You figured you &apos;d get what you wanted and then dump her like you dumped Rachel !
Hey ! I did not dump Rachel ! <unk> are we still together . Can I just ... Why don &apos;t we just let the machine get that ?
Hey Ross . It &apos;s Joey . There &apos;s a hooker over here and we thought maybe you &apos;d know something about it .
No ! No ! No ! No ! No ! I-I-I-I-I need to , I need to lie down .
So , tonight &apos;s the night of the big bachelor party ?
Yeah ! Hey ! Thanks for getting me that girl &apos;s number .
No problem . So who &apos;s the party for ?
My husband .
You hired your husband a hooker ?
She &apos;s a stripper .
No , she &apos;s a hooker .
Is that , is that what they call strippers sometimes ?
When they &apos;re <unk> .
Oh my God Stu ! I-I can &apos;t believe you did this ! Now are you absolutely sure she &apos;s a hooker ?
Either that or she &apos;s just the best , most expensive date I ever had .
Maybe she meant to get you a hooker .
Why would she do that ?
Maybe she wants you to learn something . Huh ? Now is there anything you &apos;re really bad at y &apos;know , sexually ?
This is the worst bachelor party ever !
What &apos;s taking you boys so long ?
In a minute !
In a minute ? What &apos;s gonna happen in a minute ? !
All right , all right maybe-maybe you should just ask her to leave .
Why me ? !
Hey ! It &apos;s your bachelor party .
Which is why you should do it .
I don &apos;t want to . You do it !
You do it !
You do it !
All right Rock , <unk> , <unk> who has to tell the whore to leave ! What ?

Thank you so much for coming back over .
Oh good , you &apos;re here . Yeah , and I was worried that it was going to be uncomfortable .
I know Mona , just hear me out . First of all , I &apos;m so sorry about my father yelling at you , but I heard you totally held your own . You &apos;re gonna have to tell me how you did that .
<unk> .
Okay . Um ... <unk> , yes Ross and I used to date . And yes we are gonna have a baby . But we are definitely not getting back together .
How can I be sure on that ?
Oh we <unk> drove each other crazy !
Yeah .
I mean he was <unk> , he was jealous , he could never just let the little things go !
Trying to date this woman .
Right ! But , none of that compared to how kind and-and how <unk> and <unk> he is .
Probably shouldn &apos;t touch me .
Y &apos;know , I-I-I just ... I don &apos;t want to get in the middle of something so complicated .
I know , I get it , but Mona , what relationship is not complicated ? I mean we all have our baggage ! You must too ! Why else would you still be single ? I am so gonna leave right now .
Should I leave this open for you too ?
I &apos;m not sure yet . Why didn &apos;t you just tell me about all this ?
Because what &apos;s going on with Rachel has nothing to do with how I feel about you .
Yeah ? Well you still shoulda told me .
I know and I was going to , but I thought it was better that you heard it from Rachel &apos;s father . Look I ... I made a mistake , but it &apos;s only because I really , really like you . Really !
Okay , I guess you can ... close the door now .
Forgot my purse ! Oh , you guys made up . He &apos;s a good kisser isn &apos;t he ? I &apos;m going !
I swear I didn &apos;t know she was a hooker ! I mean <unk> you let her smoke in here ?
Her ass print is still on your grandmother &apos;s <unk> , do you really want to talk about smoking ?
Y &apos;know what ? I &apos;m gonna make this up to you . I promised you a stripper , and you &apos;re gonna get a stripper .
Monica ! Wait !

Ooh , these tennis shoes are so tight . I think I &apos;ll take them off .
Could you not <unk> ?
Gotcha <unk> .

Wow , you told your dad the truth .
About an hour ago .
Wanna go see a movie ?
Yes ! Bye daddy .
... there &apos;s gonna be a wedding ! That &apos;s unacceptable Rachel ! What the hell does love have to do with it anyway ? ! There are more important things in a marriage other than love ! ... constantly thinking about things ! You have to think about the <unk> of your decision .
Hey ! I do too think about the <unk> of my decisions ! What gives you the right to ... Go to hell ! Stupid guy on my phone .
Hey Rach listen , did you know that during pregnancy your fingers <unk> up to twice their size and never go back .
Oh my ... God ! Let me see that !
You fall for it every time !
Hey !

He was in Ross &apos;s class ... <unk> band ... kinda <unk> ? Well , really <unk> . I mean I was his thin friend .
Wow ! I don &apos;t remember him . Honey , are you sure you &apos;re not talking about your <unk> boyfriend .
No that was <unk> ! Wow ! I haven &apos;t thought about him in a long time ... Anyway , umm Will &apos;s , Will &apos;s here on business and he didn &apos;t have a place to go so I invited him here .
Oh that &apos;s nice .
Oh , and by the way , he &apos;s lost a bunch of weight . I mean he looks <unk> ! Okay , I mean really , really gorgeous ! I still love Chandler .
I just want you to say it once in a while .
All right okay , just so you know , I &apos;m not gonna make a turkey this year .

Turkey &apos;s are beautiful , intelligent animals !
No they &apos;re not ! They &apos;re ugly and stupid and delicious !
All right ! Okay , it &apos;s just Phoebe . Will &apos;s still on a <unk> , Chandler doesn &apos;t eat Thanksgiving food , and Rachel &apos;s having her <unk> to <unk> .
She is ?
Remember I had to leave the room the other day when you had that <unk> chicken ?
Yeah . But I thought that was because I put the whole thing on my hand and made it walk across the table .
Anyway , it just doesn &apos;t seem worth it to make a whole turkey for just three people . Okay ? It &apos;s a lot of work .
But you gotta have turkey on Thanksgiving ! I mean , Thanksgiving with no turkey is like-like <unk> of July with no apple pie ! Or Friday with no two pizzas !
All right fine ! If it means that much to you ! But <unk> &apos;s gonna be a ton left over .
No there won &apos;t ! I promise I will finish that turkey !
All right , you &apos;re telling me you can eat an entire turkey in just one sitting ?
That &apos;s right ! &apos; Cause I &apos;m a Tribbiani ! And this is what we do ! I mean we may not be great <unk> or world <unk> , we don &apos;t read a lot or run very fast , but damnit ! We can eat !
Hey , isn &apos;t weird to think about how next year at this time they &apos;ll be a little baby at the table ? Rachel &apos;s ! But good to know where you &apos;re at !
Hey !
Hey !
Happy Thanksgiving !
You too !

Okay .

I said it was typical . <unk> of you , Rachel Green , Queen Rachel does whatever she wants in little Rachel land .
Seriously , who is this guy ?
Umm , I &apos;m sorry . Do <unk> you have a problem with me ?
I don &apos;t know ? Do I ? Do I ?
I think you do .
Apparently you were umm , a little mean to him in high school .
A little mean ? You made my life miserable !
I &apos;m-I &apos;m-I had no idea . I &apos;m sorry . I ...
Well you should be . <unk> it ! Bring on the yams !
Oh Will . But you-you &apos;ve worked so hard ...
<unk> ! ! ! !
Okay .
Uh Will umm , I just want to say that I &apos;m real sorry for whatever I-I did to you in high school ...
Oh , it wasn &apos;t just me . We had a club !
You had a club ? !
That &apos;s right , The I Hate Rachel Green Club !
Whoa ! My God ! So what , you all just joined together to hate me ? ! Who else was in this club ?
Me and Ross .
No need to point , she knows who Ross is .
So you were in an I Hate Rachel club ?
Yes he was .
No . No .
So who else was in this club ?
Uh actually , <unk> was also that exchange student from <unk> but I-I don &apos;t think he-he knew what it was .
So Ross , we went out for two years , and you never told me you were in an I Hate Rachel club .
You went out with her ? ! We had a <unk> !
That was in high school ! It &apos;s not like it was <unk> forever .
Then why did it have the word <unk> in it ?
Okay Monica , did you know about this ? !
I swear I didn &apos;t . Hey ! Is that why you guys used to go up to your bedroom and lock the door ?
Yeah .
Hmm , a little relieved , I gotta say .
Look Rach I-I &apos;m sorry , okay ? I ... I was a stupid kid , okay ? The only reason I joined ...
<unk> !
... <unk> . <unk> the club was because I was <unk> in love with you . Obviously I didn &apos;t handle it very well . But if you think about it the I Hate Rachel Club was really the I Love Rachel Club .
Uh , except that it was really the I Hate Rachel Club .
Okay . So what ? You guys would just like get together and like just say mean things about me ?
Well , we did a little more than that .
No-no ! No-no . No-no .
What ? ! What else did you do ?
We started a rumor .
What rumor ?
Oh , come on Will ! Just take off your shirt and tell us !
Ross !
It was no big deal . We-we ... said that the rumor was ... that umm ... you had both ... male and female <unk> parts .
What ? !
That &apos;s right ! We said your parents flipped a <unk> , decided to raise you as a girl , but you still had a hint of a penis .
Oh my God !
You started that ? !
What ? ! You heard that ? !
Everyone at our school heard it !
Everybody at my school heard it ! You were the <unk> cheerleader from Long Island ? !
Oh no ! ! ! ! Oh my God ! ! This is all making so much sense to me now ! This is why Adam <unk> wouldn &apos;t go out with me ! This is why <unk> <unk> would just stay in this <unk> !
Actually , <unk> <unk> is gay now . So-so that one &apos;s not really our fault .
Monica , how come you never told me this ? !
I thought it might be true . And I was afraid that you were gonna cry and then show it to me .
Joey stop staring ! There &apos;s nothing there ! It &apos;s not true !
I &apos;m afraid I &apos;m gonna need proof .
Oh !
You are my <unk> .
Joey , you don &apos;t have to finish that .
Oh yes I do . Otherwise what &apos;s next ? Today I &apos;m just a guy who can &apos;t finish a turkey , but tomorrow I &apos;m the guy who eats half a <unk> , wraps up the rest , and puts in the fridge ? No ! No , I just ... I just-I gotta change my pants . <unk> have no give .
Okay ! Okay ! Listen to what <unk> McMahon wrote in my yearbook <unk> year , &quot; Dear Rach , you &apos;re such a good person . &quot; Not girl ! <unk> !
Rach , I think you &apos;re reading a little too much into it .
&quot; Dear Rach , you &apos;re a great person . Sorry about your <unk> . &quot;
Look , what do you want me to do ? Do you want me to call everyone in the entire school and tell them it wasn &apos;t true ? !
Yes !
Could you also tell them I &apos;m <unk> now ?
Oh ! Me too !
Well look-look I &apos;m not calling anybody ! Okay ? It was like a million years ago !
I don &apos;t care how long ago it was ! You told people that I was half and half ! Y &apos;know what ? I just want to point out I never did anything to hurt you in high school .
That &apos;s not totally true .
What ?
What ?
Well you-you did start that rumor about Ross making out with Mrs. Altman , our <unk> <unk> .
How did you know that ? ! ! ! !
It &apos;s true ? ! !
No .
Yes it is ! I saw you guys going at it behind the card catalog !
Mrs. Altman ? She also made out with <unk> <unk> the night before he went back to <unk> .
I &apos;m sorry . When you were in high school you made out with a <unk> woman ?
Hey ! She didn &apos;t look 50 !
Did she look <unk> ?
Ohh , there &apos;s a picture of her in the yearbook actually .
Oh ! Wow !
She didn &apos;t <unk> well !
Well , she probably wasn &apos;t familiar with the <unk> having spent most of her life sitting for oil <unk> !
So how did this happen ? Did she , did she <unk> you to an early bird dinner ?
I was working late in the library one afternoon . It was just the two of us . She needed some help with her word <unk> . And one thing <unk> to another . If you must know , <unk> was very <unk> and <unk> . May she rest in peace ...
Didn &apos;t she walk with a <unk> ?
Only when it was <unk> ! ! I can &apos;t believe you-you told people about this ? ! Everybody knew ? ! Y &apos;know what ? I &apos;m back in the club !
Yeah !
I wanna join !

Well y &apos;know , I &apos;m just-I &apos;m just worried that bosses will see them and think they pay you too much money . Or ! Or your assistant will see them and-and want a raise !
Do you think I work at some kind of <unk> <unk> company ?
Anyway , I picked up this outfit that I want to wear and the , and the boots don &apos;t really go with it .
You said that you paid all that money because those boots go with <unk> , dresses , and pants !

Oh , their number is on the contact sheet .
Uh-huh . Uh-huh . Umm , could-could I get a copy of that ? &apos; Cause Carol threw it out , she lost ours . She &apos;s such a <unk> , but man what a hot piece of ass .

So , I guess you and I should talk about Jack and Ben right now .
Unless ! Unless umm , okay I-I would be willing to go to the concert , umm , all the while thinking about the children of course .
Are you here for tickets ?
Oh , thank you . Four would be great .
I &apos;m not giving concert tickets to someone who &apos;d use their son like this !

Okay , I &apos;m sorry . I think I can walk the rest of the way now . Just-just give me my boots .
I don &apos;t have your boots .

Y &apos;know what ? You can say goodbye to the tan ones .
Okay . All right .
Okay .

Joey , just because they &apos;re not getting married doesn &apos;t mean this is going to be a disaster . Maybe they have a plan !
Oh ? Oh ! Okay ! Okay ! Let &apos;s hear their plan ! Now , what &apos;s the future look like for Dina and Bobby ?
Well ... I really have high hopes for my band .
You were right . He is funny .

Really ?
Dina , if you &apos;re having a baby you should be married ! Even if it is to Bobby ! Dude , that &apos;s not a compliment !

So <unk> ! What are you gonna do ? You &apos;re gonna have the baby and-and raise it by yourself ... without a husband ? ! You can &apos;t be a single mother alone ! You &apos;re gonna ruin your life !
Oh excuse me ! Am I <unk> my life ?

One pregnant woman at a time , please ! I just want you to be okay .
So <unk> her to marry Bobby is gonna make that happen ?
Maybe ! Well ! Well ... so-so uh , what kind of music does <unk> <unk> forget it ! I can &apos;t !
Joey , I am scared to death about this . But I really think I can do it , I &apos;m just gonna need some help . And Bobby &apos;s gonna be here the whole time .
You bet I am ! And to answer your earlier question , we &apos;re <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Look , Rachel &apos;s told me how much easier you &apos;ve made all this on her . Why can &apos;t you do that for me ?
Because ! &apos; Cause ... &apos; Cause you &apos;re my baby sister !
And you &apos;re my big brother ! I mean , you &apos;re my favorite guy in the whole world . I &apos;m not even scared to tell mom and dad . I was scared of telling you .
Well I &apos;d be scared of them , but all right .
Joey , I can &apos;t stand the thought of having this baby with you mad at me . I want him to have his uncle . Is my baby gonna have his Uncle Joey ?
Of course he &apos;s gonna have his Uncle Joey !

Look at that guy by the window , wow !

Oh , what is wrong with me lately ? I mean it &apos;s like every guy I <unk> mean look here . Look at that guy for example , I mean normally that &apos;s not someone I would-would be attracted to , but right now , with the way I &apos;m feeling , all I want to do is rip off his <unk> and fanny pack .
Wait a second ! This is about the fourth month of your pregnancy , right ?
Yeah .
This is completely normal , around the fourth month your hormones start going crazy .

Chandler , why would you do that ?
Because it &apos;s awesome .
You think this is <unk> ?
Well y &apos;know , they only give you three letters , so after <unk> it is a bit of a challenge .
Hey wait a minute , this one isn &apos;t dirty .
It is when you put it together with that one .
Ah , well if you don &apos;t clear this off , you won &apos;t be getting one of those from me . But Ben &apos;s coming over here tomorrow to play this game , this can &apos;t be there .

How do you do that ?
Now you can &apos;t tell anyone , but uh ... I put on <unk> lip <unk> .
Oh my God !
Yeah , like a <unk> to a flame , I &apos;m telling ya . Okay all right , so now you go .

You &apos;re just saying that &apos; cause I said no to your name !
I &apos;m really , really not .
How-how about you each get five <unk> ?
All right .
All right .
That sounds fair .
Yeah ! I don &apos;t think you &apos;re going to need it though . Okay , check this out . If it &apos;s a girl , Rain .
Veto .
Why ?
Rain ? Hi . Hi , my name is Rain . I have my own <unk> , and my dress is made out of <unk> .
I know her ! I bought homemade soap from her at a Dead show !
Okay , how about , for a guy , <unk> ?
Ross , why do you hate our child ?
Fine , you go .
Okay , James .
Huh .
But only if it &apos;s a girl .
Oh , veto . How <unk> , I like Ruth ! What about Ruth ?
Oh ! I &apos;m sorry ! Are we having an <unk> ? How about <unk> ?
Veto . <unk> ?
Veto . <unk> ?
Veto . <unk> ?
Veto .
Is it me , or is veto starting to sound really good ?
Hey .
Boy , do I have a surprise for you !
Sex on the balcony ?
No , but someone &apos;s really not going to get over that idea , are they ?
What is it ?
I drew you a bath !
Honey , I don &apos;t like baths ! Could you <unk> me a picture of us having sex on the balcony ?
Please , could you just try it for me ? Come on , I used all my best stuff ! I-I-I lit some candles . I put on some music . I used bath salts , plus bubble bath ! And got you this little plastic Navy ship . So it &apos;s a boy bath !
Well , this does <unk> it up a bit .
I swear , if you try it , you will love it !
All right , if I do this , can we at least discuss sex on the balcony ?
Absolutely .
Bet I know how that <unk> &apos;s going to go .
All right , this isn &apos;t so bad . I like the flower smell ! Which is okay , because I &apos;ve got my boat .
So ?
Oh my God .
I told you you were a bath person ! Hey , when you get out , maybe I can give you a <unk> !
I &apos;m going to need a bigger boat .
I don &apos;t think you had an open mind about the name Ruth . I mean , come on , little <unk> Geller , how-how cute is that ?
Oh , oh my God ! I can practically hear the <unk> tiles !
Okay ! All your <unk> look fine . Now , are you two interested in knowing the sex of the baby ?
Uh , no . No , we &apos;re not .
But you have it right there in that file ? You could tell us whether it &apos;s a boy or a girl ? <unk> or Sandrine ? Phoebe or Phoebo ?
That &apos;s right . But if you don &apos;t want to know ...
No , no , we want to wait , right ?
Right . Right .
Oh , I &apos;ll be right back . And , uh , I know it &apos;s really not my place , but please don &apos;t name your child Phoebo .
So , which of these babies do you think is the <unk> ?
What ? Rach ! Come on , that &apos;s terrible ! They &apos;re ... uh ... they &apos;re babies . They <unk> &apos;re all beautiful .
Third one from the left ?
Yeah , why is it staring at me ? I think it knows I &apos;m talking about it . Don &apos;t-don &apos;t <unk> ! !
What ? !
You &apos;re looking !
I didn &apos;t !
I saw you !
Okay fine , I did . But I didn &apos;t see anything , I swear .
<unk> on you ! Ugly baby <unk> you !
Okay , but Ross just listen to me ...
No , no , no , no ! Don &apos;t tell me ! I don &apos;t want to know !
But I couldn &apos;t even if I wanted to , because I don &apos;t know ! I swear ; I didn &apos;t see anything , and I don &apos;t want to know ! It was just a <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> . Don &apos;t-don &apos;t you have any <unk> ?
Okay , a couple months late on the lecture , Ross .
Hello ?
I &apos;m in the bathroom , can you come in here ? I think there &apos;s something wrong .
You know what ? I-I think I &apos;ll wait out here .
I &apos;m in the bathtub .
Oh . What &apos;s wrong ?
I drew my own bath , but I did it wrong ! The water &apos;s <unk> . The salt didn &apos;t <unk> and is now ... lodged places . And the <unk> I used don &apos;t compliment each other . <unk> and <unk> !
What ?
The bath salts ! They &apos;re starting to <unk> ! It &apos;s different . It &apos;s interesting .
Okay , let &apos;s talk about something else .
Yeah ! Sure , sure . So , what was going on with you today ? Oh-oh-oh !
Well , I actually had the <unk> conversation with Joey . He was talking about rules and right and wrong and ...
I had the exact same conversation .
You did ? What was he talking about ?
I don &apos;t know ! Joey hasn &apos;t had this much trouble getting out words since we saw him in <unk> !
That was a long night .
All right , let &apos;s break this down . What exactly did he say to you ?
Okay , he was talking about rules .
Uh-huh .
Umm , and looking at people differently .
He didn &apos;t say anything about that to me .
What did he tell you ?
He was asking all these questions about you , me , and London . And , of course the <unk> that <unk> this all together , the rules .
Okay . So you , me and London . <unk> at people differently . Maybe he wants to do what you and I did in London with someone .
But what did he mean by rules ?
Wait a minute ! He stopped talking the minute Phoebe came in !
Because he was looking at her differently .
And Phoebe is his friend , so he thinks that would be breaking the rules !
My God ! He wants to do it with Phoebe in London !
You guys ?
Just a minute ! That &apos;s Mrs. Tribbiani !
You don &apos;t say anything .
Why would I say anything ? That two of our best friends could start the greatest love <unk> of their lives ! And they would have me to thank , and we could all start having babies ?
I &apos;m not going to let you say anything .
You just stay here !
Oh , God !
Oh , hey , Monica , I brought back your iron .
Oh , you had that ?
Uh-huh .
I thought I lost it . I got a new one , like , a month ago .
Oh , just as well , I broke this one .
What ?
Nothing .
Okay .
I mean , I-I , I really shouldn &apos;t say . I mean , I &apos;m really not supposed to .
Fine .
It &apos;s a <unk> !
Then it &apos;s really too bad that you can &apos;t tell me .
Somebody likes you !
Is it Chandler ?
No !
Well , then tell him to stop staring !
It &apos;s Joey !
Really ? ! Joey ? ! You don &apos;t say .
Is it something you &apos;d be interested in ?
I don &apos;t know , I don &apos;t know , I don &apos;t know . You know , I mean , on the one hand , Mother may I ? But y &apos;know on the other hand ... No . No , I can &apos;t . We &apos;re friends . No , oh , no . I don &apos;t want to <unk> what we have .
I guess that makes sense . So , you think you &apos;re going to talk to him ?
Sure , yeah . I mean , it &apos;s Joey . I don &apos;t want him to get hurt . Well , I must say , I am on fire ! First Chandler , now Joey !
Not Chandler , just Joey .
Sure .
Hey .
Hey .
You know what ? I &apos;ve been thinking about it . I &apos;m really coming around on the name Ruth . I think I would actually consider naming our child that .
Rach , I-I can &apos;t tell you how-how much that means to me ! Ohh ... Wait a minute . Wait a minute . You-you hated the name Ruth ! <unk> would you change your mind ? Unless , you know we &apos;re never going to have to use it . You did see the <unk> . You know it &apos;s a boy !
I didn &apos;t see anything ! I actually changed my mind about the name .
I don &apos;t think so ! You &apos;re just giving me Ruth so you &apos;ll get to name it when it &apos;s a boy , and that &apos;s when you &apos;ll swoop in and name him <unk> or <unk> or <unk> .
I <unk> ?
Veto .
Fine .
Unless ... You <unk> that I would figure all this out and you know that it actually is a girl , and you really do want her to be named Ruth ! Well , I &apos;m not falling for that ! Okay ? Ruth is off the table !
But Ross , you want the name Ruth !
Not like this !
Hey .
Hey . Well , what &apos;s up ?
Umm , Joey , I know .
What ?
I <unk> .
<unk> ?
I know about your feelings .
Oh my God . You do ?
Yes , and I &apos;m sorry . I-I know things worked out for Chandler and Monica , but that &apos;s very <unk> .
I know . I know . And this is so much more complicated than it was for those guys . I mean , it &apos;s Rachel for God <unk> .
For God <unk> , it &apos;s Rachel !
I know . I know . And she &apos;s not only my friend ; she &apos;s my pregnant friend ! She &apos;s my pregnant friend who &apos;s Ross &apos; ex !
Yeah that &apos;s Rachel . Beat me over the head with it .
What am I going to do ? You know , and I keep , I keep trying to get rid of these feelings , y &apos;know ? I stayed up all last night and made a list of everything I don &apos;t like about her . You want to hear it ?
Yeah .
She made me switch to light <unk> . That &apos;s it ! That &apos;s all I got ! And , you know what ? It tastes the same and my pants fit better !
Joey , I just think you &apos;re getting worked up over nothing . This is probably just a crush .
You think ?
Absolutely ! Y &apos;know , you get this rush of feelings , but then it goes away .
Yeah , just a crush ! That &apos;s all this is ! It &apos;s a crush ! I &apos;m Joey ; I don &apos;t get deep feelings .
That &apos;s right , there you go ! <unk> happen all the time ! I know I &apos;ve had them for all you guys . Well , except for Ross and Chandler . And I &apos;m sure you &apos;ve had them for us .
Not really .
Mm-hmm . <unk> me a bone here .
So , I uh ... I called the doctor and now we both know the sex of the baby .
What ?
That &apos;s right . The student has become the <unk> .
Ross , I swear , I don &apos;t know .
Oh , come on , you know it &apos;s a girl !
A what ? !
You really didn &apos;t know ?
We &apos;re having a girl ?
No .
That &apos;s what you just said !
No .
You said girl !
Yes . I &apos;m ... I &apos;m sorry . I &apos;m so sorry .
I &apos;m not ! We &apos;re having a girl ! Sometimes I can &apos;t believe it &apos;s with <unk> still ! We &apos;re having a girl !

Oh , yes ! We &apos;ll have ourselves a little baby Ruth ...

Well , if anyone is keeping score , I no longer eat <unk> .
Hey uh , can I , can I talk to you guys for a second ?
Yeah .

Are you breaking up with us ?
The thing is ... &apos; cause I live with Rachel I &apos;m here for a lot of the stuff , okay ? And Ross ... Ross is missing everything . So ...

Maybe you two should live together .
Are you asking me to move out ? Do you not want me here ?
Oh no-no , no-no I love living with you . It just seems that ... if you &apos;re gonna have a roommate , y &apos;know it might as well be the father .
But Joey , I don &apos;t think Ross wants me to move into his apartment and <unk> his life like that . I <unk> he does .
No I-I-I would love to be around for you and the baby . And we-we can just try it like on a temporary <unk> .
But Ross , its you and me !
So ? Sure ! But it-it wouldn &apos;t be anything romantic . And I &apos;m-I &apos;m dating <unk> Mona ! I was supposed to meet her like an hour ago ! What is wrong with me ? !
All right now , so ? What do you think ?
I don &apos;t know . Is it crazy ?

I thought ... maybe ... you got me porn for Valentine &apos;s Day .
Chandler , if you thought I was going to get you porn for Valentine &apos;s Day ... you were right ! Apparently , it &apos;s about a young girl who moves to the big city , you know , in search of <unk> , but ends up having sex with a lot of guys ! Yeah , it got four starts ! Oh , wait a minute . Those aren &apos;t stars . Anyway , you want to take a look ?
Well , I &apos;m not really in a sexy mood right now .
Honey , what &apos;s going on ?
Well , remember the first time we saw <unk> ?
Mm-hmm .
How long it took to go back in the water ?
Chandler , we can &apos;t let this tape wreck Valentine &apos;s Day !
You don &apos;t know . You didn &apos;t see it .

I think it &apos;s interesting .
I do too ! I missed you !
I missed you , too ! So , how was your week ?
Oh , it was good ! It was good . Actually , the baby started kicking !
How exciting !
Yeah ! I know ! It was . Oh ... the only sad thing is I wasn &apos;t around when it happened for the first time .
Oh no .
Yeah , I &apos;m missing out on all this other stuff , too . So , Joey <unk> Rachel move in with me .
Yeah right !
What ?
Joey cracks me up ! It &apos;s like , &apos; Yeah , why don &apos;t you have your ex-wife move in with you ? That wouldn &apos;t be awkward at all ! &apos;
Huh ... uh-huh .
Huh , could you imagine . I go away for a few days , and come back , and my boyfriend is living with some woman he got pregnant !
So , what &apos;d you tell him ?
Just a second !
How could you not tell Mona that Rachel is living with you ?
I don &apos;t know , she seemed to think it was such a crazy idea ! Um , plus , she , uh , she got me taffy !
<unk> , really ? I &apos;ve never had any .
Ever ? !
Well , I think my mother was too busy planning her <unk> to provide <unk> treats . Thank you ! So what , you &apos;re just never going to tell her ?
Oh , no , no , no , I will ! I just want to butter her up , first ! You know , I &apos;m going to take her to an amazing Valentine &apos;s dinner . Do all this romantic stuff , and then , just when she thinks I &apos;m the best boyfriend in the world , then I &apos;m going to tell her that my pregnant ex-girlfriend is living with me .
she &apos;s a lucky , lucky lady ! So , where are you going <unk> the mother of crap is up with this stuff ? Oh , God . Is it gum , is it food ? What &apos;s the deal ? Oh , it &apos;s nice ! May I try a pink one ?
So , between her and me being friends , and her history with Ross , it just isn &apos;t going to happen . It would be like you falling in love with a cat .
Hey !
Hey .
Hey , buddy . How &apos;s my favorite dog , huh ? How &apos;s my favorite dog ? You &apos;re <unk> . Did you give him a beer ?
No .
Will you excuse us , we need to talk for a moment .
Yeah , sure . Go ahead . Oh , me , right !
He &apos;s miserable ! What happened to him ?
Nothing . We just talked about stuff .
What stuff ?
Rachel stuff .
Oh ... Joey , you bummed him out ! This was the happiest dog in the world , and he spends half a day with you , and look at him !
He &apos;s breathing !
Okay , I &apos;m going to take him back to <unk> &apos;s .
No , no , no , no ! He &apos;s fine ! Look , look , look ! Here &apos;s your ball ! Get your ball ! Get your ball ! Get your ball ! My God , what have I done to you , huh ? I broke the dog ! Pheebs , I broke the dog !

Oh , I &apos;ve got big Valentine &apos;s plans ! I &apos;ve got my Chinese food on the way , and the rest of your <unk> taffy !
Y &apos;know , it &apos;s interesting ! Most people think that &apos;s made with <unk> , when in <unk>
Ross , we actually watched the <unk> together .
Ooh ! My Chinese food ! Let me get my cash !
Mona ? What <unk> ! What are you doing here ? I &apos;m , um , supposed to pick you up !
Change of plans , I made you a special Valentine &apos;s dinner ! Surprise !
<unk> !
Oh , hey , Mona !
Hi ! Hi . Hi , Rachel ! What &apos;s she doing here ?
I have no idea !
I &apos;ll be watching TV if anybody needs me .
Seriously , what is she doing ?
Uh ... lately , she just likes hanging out here .
Why ?
I think she &apos;s lonely .
Okay , but it &apos;s Valentine &apos;s Day !
I know .
Can &apos;t we just ask her to go ?
No , no . She &apos;s way to emotional . And by emotional I mean crazy .
I &apos;m not here ! That &apos;s just my Chinese food !
Oh , my God ! She has food delivered here ?
Mm-hmm . She &apos;s-she &apos;s emotional , but , but <unk> .
You know what I &apos;m going to do ? I &apos;m going to get in my sweats , and eat this in bed !
And you thought she was going to be in our way ! So , why don &apos;t you , uh , open the champagne , and I &apos;ll be right back . I &apos;ve got a surprise for you .
You got another ex-wife back there ?
Please start drinking !
I &apos;m just going to grab the phone .
Oh , Rachel ! Wait ! Hey , I hope you don &apos;t take this the wrong way , but , but , um ... what are you doing ?
Oh , I &apos;m sorry ! Do you need the phone ?
No , no . Listen , Ross is too nice to say anything , but this is his apartment , and , and , we gotta have some <unk> , so why don &apos;t you go back to your place and give us some privacy ?
But , but , Mona , I live here .
Happy Valentine &apos;s Day ! ... Or something to remember me by .
How long has it been this time ?
90 seconds .
That &apos;s better . 90 seconds is a long time not to think about it ... except all I did was think about it .
You know , it <unk> me ? Up &apos; til now , the worst thing I ever saw , was my father doing tequila shots off the naked <unk> . After this , I would <unk> make that my <unk> !
Okay , well , we have to get past this ! Why don &apos;t we get rid of the tape and pretend it never <unk> ?
I can do that .
Okay .
Okay . Now all we &apos;ve got to do is get rid of this chair .
Oh , thank God !
Oh , I know !
Come in !
Hi ! I &apos;m so sorry to barge in on your Valentine &apos;s , but I had to get away from all the yelling . Mona is dumping Ross .
Oh , my God .
Poor Ross .
Oh , great . We have to watch him do yoga in his underwear , but for this he <unk> the drapes !
Rach , you know that <unk> tape you wanted to see ? It &apos;s here .
Oh , And We Should <unk> You , Before You Watch It don &apos;t watch it .
Why ? You saw it ? Is it scary ?
Well , let &apos;s just say it &apos;s ironic how <unk> of someone being born can make you want to kill yourself .
Well , now , wait . Now I &apos;m all freaked out . Come on , you guys will watch it with me .
No , but I will leave a sweater that smells like me right next to you !
C &apos;mon , seriously , you guys , you &apos;re not going to make me watch this alone !
She &apos;s right ... of course not . Honey , get the tape .
This reminds me of a very <unk> part of the tape . Okay , here we go .
Okay . Ooh , my ! <unk> ! Why is that baby torturing that woman ? !
Why have I seen this thing three times ? !
It &apos;s ... still beautiful .
Uh ! It &apos;s horrible !
I know ! I know , I &apos;m so sorry for you !
Oh , my God !
Wait , you guys , look !
What ? Did her ass <unk> ? !
No , the baby &apos;s out ! Look , look !
Oh , look at those little fingers and toes !
And look how happy the mom is now !
Oh ... Rach !
Oh , screw you guys , you don &apos;t have to do it !
Hey , hey , man !
Hey , what &apos;s up ?
Uh ... Mona just dumped me .
Oh , man , I &apos;m sorry . Why ?
Well , with everything that &apos;s been going on lately , I haven &apos;t exactly been the perfect boyfriend . You know , I , uh , I didn &apos;t tell her I got Rachel pregnant . I gave her a key to my apartment , and then had the <unk> changed ! And then I lied to her about Rachel moving in with me . In a way , I actually judge her for not breaking up with me sooner , you know ?
Still , that really sucks , man . Especially on Valentine &apos;s Day .
Yeah . Wait a minute . What are you doing here ? Joey Tribbiani without a date on Valentine &apos;s Day ? What &apos;s going on , huh ? Girl trouble ?
Sort of .
Really ? !
You don &apos;t have to seem so happy about it .
Oh , sorry . Well , look , maybe I can help you with it .
Oh , I ... I <unk>
Hey , whatever it is , I am sure it has happened to me . Y &apos;know , actually <unk> I got dumped during sex .
Anyway , so , uh , so what is it ?
Forget about it . It &apos;s no big deal .
C &apos;mon ! Joey ! What is it ?
It &apos;s nothing .
Hey , hey , it &apos;s me . Why can &apos;t you tell me ?
Okay , uh ... sit down . Um ... there &apos;s this woman that I like . A lot . But , uh ... it can &apos;t happen .
She &apos;s not a Tribbiani ?
No !
I knew it . So , is she someone from work ?
Yes .
Well , uh , does she like you ?
Sometimes I think maybe she could . But it doesn &apos;t matter , because I can &apos;t do anything about it .
Why not ?
Well , it &apos;s complicated . She &apos;s with this other guy . For a long time . Someone from work , too . And I could never do that to the guy , because we &apos;re really good friends .
So , uh , this guy , she used to go out with , is , uh ... is he still in love with her ?
No . I don &apos;t think so .
Okay . Um ... is he a good guy ?
Yeah , he &apos;s the best .
Then talk to him ! He might be fine with it .
Oh , I don &apos;t know .
Joey , it &apos;s worth finding out . I mean , if you really like her .
I do ! So much ! I can &apos;t stop thinking about her ! I can &apos;t sleep , I-
Okay , Joey , you know what ? You have to go for it . How often does this happen to you , huh ? You owe it to yourself .
Here &apos;s your warm milk .
I &apos;m going to ... uh ... I &apos;m going to , um , put the <unk> in it at home .
Oh , yeah .
Anyway ... seriously , uh ... just ... just talk to the guy , okay ? And tell me how it goes .
It &apos;s Rachel .
You &apos;re going to have a baby , and you need to be prepared . Now , you &apos;re going to make yourself watch the whole thing . Just do it !
I came to the big city to become a star ! I &apos;ll do ... anything to make that happen !
Anything ?
Hmm ... maybe it starts with how she gets pregnant .
There &apos;s this woman , that I like . A lot . Well , it &apos;s complicated . She &apos;s with this other guy . For a long time . And I could never do that to the guy , y &apos;know ? &apos; <unk> we &apos;re really good friends .
So , uh , this guy , she used to go out with , is , uh ... is he a good guy ?
Yeah , he &apos;s the best .
Then talk to him ! He might be fine with it .
Oh , I don &apos;t know .
Joey , it &apos;s worth finding out . I mean , if you really like her .
I do ! So much ! I can &apos;t stop thinking about her ! I can &apos;t sleep , I-
Okay , Joey , you know what ? You have to go for it . How often does this happen to you , huh ? You owe it to yourself .
It &apos;s Rachel .
Did you <unk> &apos;m sorry , did you just say it &apos;s Rachel ?
Yes .
Um , you ... you like Rachel ?
Yes . I like Rachel .
Rachel ? !
Yeah , okay but look , buy <unk> , y &apos;know , y &apos;know who else I like ? You ! And it-it doesn &apos;t get said enough . I like you Ross .
But <unk> ? !
Yeah , but it &apos;s not a big deal .
It &apos;s not a big deal ? Oh , I &apos;m sorry I just ... um , I ... what about all the stuff you-you just said ? I mean how about , I <unk> can &apos;t stop thinking about her . Like how you can &apos;t sleep ?
I &apos;m an actor , y &apos;know ? <unk> a group , we tend to be over <unk> .
Rachel who &apos;s carrying my baby ? Rachel ?
Look no , I-I know it &apos;s bad , and I know it &apos;s wrong . Okay ? But-but it &apos;s not like anything &apos;s ever gonna happen . Y &apos;know ? <unk> are just feelings , they &apos;re gonna go away .
Y &apos;know what ? I-I gotta go .
Oh come on Ross ! Hey Ross-Ross don &apos;t ...
I just-y <unk> just have <unk> ? !
Rachel ? ! !
Oh-oh ! Okay , she &apos;s kicking !
Oh ! She &apos;s growing inside you .
Whoa ! !
Oh !
Wow that was a big one .
I think that &apos;s the <unk> girl ever to reject me .
Oh hey you guys !
Oh hey !
Hi !
Hey listen let me ask you , do you believe in soul mates ?
Oh yes I do . I do . I believe that there is one perfect person out there for everyone . And do you know how you find him ? You stop looking for him . That &apos;s why I stopped looking for <unk> <unk> . He &apos;ll find me .
Uh-huh , and you ?
No . I mean I believe that uh , certain people are more <unk> for each other and I believe in falling in love , but soul mates , I don &apos;t think they exist .
Okay , good .
Why ?
Well last night , I met Monica &apos;s .
What ?
Yeah , I had a date with this guy , and I swear to God , he is her other half .
Come on , don &apos;t be crazy . You don &apos;t think there &apos;s someone out there better <unk> for Monica than me , do ya ?
Well , what &apos;s he like ? !
Well he &apos;s tall .
Uh-huh .
He has brown hair .
Of course , of course .
A tall guy with hair similar to mine , oh <unk> universe !
He works with food !
Oh sure . <unk> ?
Obviously , and he &apos;s British .
Oh , I was just gonna ask !
Yeah ? And , he &apos;s-he &apos;s so <unk> and mature and confident .
Oh , it &apos;s so sad they never had a chance to meet .
<unk> , the guy she <unk> for can &apos;t hear what you &apos;re talking about .
Oh , I &apos;m so sorry . Um , and maybe I &apos;m wrong ! I <unk> &apos;know I &apos;m gonna go out with him again , I &apos;ll find out more .
You believe that this guy is <unk> for someone else and you &apos;re still gonna date him ?
Well , he may not be my soul mate , but a girl &apos;s gotta eat .
Hey .
Hey .
I just talked to Joey , I just-I want to see how you were .
Oh y &apos;know , I <unk> can &apos;t believe it . Joey and Rachel I mean it &apos;s ... It &apos;s like you and me going out , only <unk> !
All right , I know you &apos;re hurting , and-and I want to be supportive , but don &apos;t say that again .
Oh my God ! What if , what if they get married ? Then he &apos;d be the <unk> of my child .
Honey , I don &apos;t think that &apos;s something we need to worry about ! First of all he &apos;s-he &apos;s never gonna tell her how he feels about her . And even if he did you have no idea how she &apos;d react .
Sure , because women never like Joey . Y &apos;know , I think he &apos;s a virgin .
Joey ... he &apos;s not even thinking about going after Rachel !
He &apos;s not ?
No ! All he &apos;s thinking about is how you &apos;re taking this ! I mean , listen it &apos;s totally freaking him out . He &apos;s talking about moving to Vermont .
Why ?
He says he wants to leave the country . He thinks you hate him .
Hate him ? I ... No , I don &apos;t hate him . It &apos;s just it &apos;s Rachel , y &apos;know ?
Honey I can &apos;t even imagine how hard this must be for you . But , I don &apos;t want you to lose Joey over it . And right now he just needs to know that you &apos;re still his friend .
Okay . Okay , I &apos;ll talk to him .
All right . Now do it soon , he just asked me how to <unk> his dollars into Vermont money .
Oh ! Hi !

Not really .

So Don , what-what other <unk> do you like ?
Well , <unk> , 27 &amp; <unk> ! And there &apos;s this great little place , Alessandro &apos;s .

Oh , I &apos;d like a latte . Oh y &apos;know what ? If you &apos;re gonna talk about me , I &apos;m gonna go with you .
What are you doing ? !
Nothing ! I swear to God I didn &apos;t know you guys would be here ! And the good news is you didn &apos;t believe in soul mates . So ...
I believe in tall , handsome strangers who hit on my wife !
They &apos;re just talking , and y &apos;know what ? Just because I think they &apos;re soul mates doesn &apos;t mean anything &apos;s gonna happen .
Phoebe , good work .
Yeah ?
Yeah ! Oh he &apos;s great , I love him .
Don &apos;t worry , we &apos;ll find you someone else .
Hey .
Hey .
Look , I understand if you came by to hit me , I deserve it .
No , I don &apos;t want to hit you .
Oh what then ? <unk> me ?
No .

No , no I don &apos;t want to do anything to you . All right ? I just want to tell you that I &apos;m not mad at you and ... and that I certainly do not hate you . I just , I just came here to say that .
Oh <unk> Ross-Ross ! Do you <unk> come in for a beer or something ?
Uh ... yeah sure .
Do uh , do you got any beer ? <unk> I got is this <unk> stuff that Rachel left . I don &apos;t ...
Okay .
Hey look Ross , you need to understand something okay ? I uh ... I am never gonna act on this Rachel thing , okay ? I-I would never do anything to <unk> my friendship with you .
Thank you .
Anyway , it uh ... look it &apos;ll just ... take me a while to get over her , that &apos;s all . I &apos;m not even sure how to do that , I mean I &apos;ve never been in love before so ...
What ? ! You &apos;re in love with her .
Yeah , I thought you knew that .
Umm , no .
Wow . Hey look , if it helps , I don &apos;t want to feel this way . <unk> . I just keep thinking , &quot; Ah , I &apos;ll get over this . &quot; Y &apos;know ? I <unk> just keeps gettin &apos; harder . I don &apos;t , I don &apos;t know what to do . Y &apos;know ? What do I do ?
I think you need to tell her how you feel .
Okay that &apos;s the green stuff talkin &apos; .
No , I &apos;m serious . You-you need to find out where she is , because if she &apos;s not where you are , then you can start to move past this .
But what if <unk> I &apos;m not saying she will <unk> ...
If she is where you are then uh ... then my feeling weird about it shouldn &apos;t stand in the way .
Are you sure ?
Yeah . Look if-if she &apos;s gonna end up with somebody else , the truth is she couldn &apos;t find a better guy . So ...
Hey thanks .
So when do you think you &apos;re gonna talk to her ?
Oh my God I have to tell her ! I haven &apos;t even thought about what I will say . What should I say ?
I &apos;m understanding , but let &apos;s not get carried away .
I &apos;m sorry , you &apos;re right . What am I gonna say ? Oh !
Yeah , tell me about it .
... so I &apos;ve been <unk> phasing out the wine <unk> and focusing more on the cheese side of things .
Cheese you say ? That &apos;s some pretty smelly work , huh Don ?
Excuse me ?
Cheese , it &apos;s smelly . You must smell a lot of the time too .
Uh , not really . But when it comes to cheese , I &apos;m one of the people who thinks the <unk> the better .

Honey , you gotta talk to her .
I can &apos;t ! Y &apos;know ? You guys don &apos;t know what it &apos;s like to put yourself out there like that and just get shot down .
I don &apos;t know what that &apos;s like ? ! Up until I was 25 I thought the only <unk> to , &quot; I love you , &quot; was , &quot; Oh crap ! &quot;
Hello ? No rejection ? I got shot down at fat camp ! Boy , kids are mean when they &apos;re hungry .
All right so , so what do I do ?
This is Rachel . I mean , what are you gonna do , never going to talk to her again ? I mean I know it &apos;s weird , it &apos;s awkward , but you gotta at least try .
Yeah . Okay . Whoa ! I almost forgot this was on your ...
We didn &apos;t play it ! !
Okay , so when you &apos;re done with your tea I &apos;ll look at your leaves and tell you your <unk> .

Umm ... Wow , all right . Wow ! Yay ! Ooh , I &apos;m gonna meet a guy ! And really soon ! And he &apos;s gonna be the man of my dreams . Probably not the guy I had a dream about last night .
Hey ! Has anyone seen my shirt ? It &apos;s a button down , like a , like a faded salmon ?
You mean your pink shirt ?
<unk> salmon color .
No , I-I haven &apos;t seen your pink shirt .
Great ! Great . Then I must &apos;ve left it at Mona &apos;s . I knew it !
Well , I &apos;m sure you get another one at Ann Taylor &apos;s .
That &apos;s my favorite shirt ! Okay ? I love that shirt !
Well just ask Mona to give it back !
I don &apos;t know . I mean I-I guess I could . It &apos;s just that we didn &apos;t really end things such good terms . And if I go over there I &apos;d be <unk> the one thing she asked me to do when we broke up , jump up my own ass and die .
Oh wait a second you guys ... for the last couple weeks I &apos;ve been that guy everywhere I go . We take the same bus . We go to the same <unk> , the same dry cleaners ; maybe he &apos;s the tea guy .
Phoebe , did you see that ? ! He totally checked you out ! He is so cute ! Mine has a picture of The <unk> People , what does that mean ?
Hi !
Hey .
Hi .
Hi .

So I thought Joey and I would be okay once we hung out , but it &apos;s not even like we know how to be with each other anymore .
I know it &apos;s tough now , but things will get better .
How do you know that ? What if it just gets worse and worse and worse , to the point where we can &apos;t even be in the same room with each other ? !
I &apos;m not great at the advice , can I interest you in a sarcastic comment ? Some cheese ?
Honey , what is the <unk> <unk> CD in the <unk> Stevens case ?

Well , if we &apos;re gonna do that we should come up with some kind of order . Y &apos;know <unk> or by <unk> ?
Hmm , I don &apos;t know . We really have to talk this through .
Oh my God ! ! You guys have such problems ! ! I feel so terrible for you !
Okay , I-I &apos;m sorry . You and Joey , your both focusing on this uncomfortable thing , what you need to do is to change the subject . Next time you see him try to get him talking about something else .
Oh yeah . That makes sense .
Yeah , like I don &apos;t know , maybe you have a work problem that you need his advice on .
Ooh , I can do that .
Good . Uh honey , the <unk> <unk> <unk> ? Really ?

What was wrong with Mona ?
Open it ! Open it ! Open it !
Yeah baby !
So we never got to hear about your wedding !
We were surprise that we weren &apos;t invited .
No , no , it was just our parents and 1 or 2 friends . It was a small wedding .
But it was beautiful . I mean it was small , but kind of <unk> .
Where did you have it ?
On a <unk> , in <unk> , at <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> Isn &apos;t She Lovely as I walked down the aisle .
Really ?
Yeah , <unk> &apos;s an old family friend .
Oh my God . That sounds amazing . I would love to see pictures .
So would I. You wouldn &apos;t think that Annie <unk> would forget to put film in the camera .
Would you excuse us for a second ? Umm .... what are you doing ?
What ? I &apos;m not you . This may be the only wedding I ever have . I want it to be amazing .
Okay , okay . Ooooh , ooh maybe I <unk> in on a <unk> .
Okay , Ross , it has to be realistic .
Are you okay ? You seem kind of quiet .
No , I &apos;m fine . I &apos;m great . I &apos;m with you .
And I &apos;m with you ! What a great time to be alive ! Look at this <unk> thing . What an <unk> solution to man &apos;s plate <unk> problems .
<unk> huh , yeah .
Ah ! <unk> ! Let me feed you one .
No , that &apos;s not necessary .
Please .
No , actually I don &apos;t eat ...
I won &apos;t quit until you try .
Okay , fine ! Fine ! Mmm ... <unk> ....
What are they like ? I &apos;ve never had one .
Why don &apos;t you just try one ?
No , they look too weird .
What are you doin &apos; ?
Just going over my toast . Those two will never know what hit &apos; em . I can &apos;t wait . They &apos;re going to be crying so hard . They &apos;re going to be fighting for breath .
Ya know if you want to , I can just hold them down and you could .
And my <unk> was lace , made by blind , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> ?
Well , not at first , but it was very <unk> work and they said even though they lost their <unk> , it was all worth it .
I &apos;ll bet you looked beautiful ...
Well , I don &apos;t know about that , but some said that I looked like a floating <unk> .
So , how did you propose ?
Oh yeah . That &apos;s a great story .
Well , um , actually , I-I took her to the planetarium . That &apos;s-that &apos;s where we had our first date . Um , she walked in and I had the room filled with <unk> , her favorite flower ...
Oh that is so sweet !
Shhh ! I want to hear the rest !
Then , <unk> <unk> singing The Way You Look Tonight came on the sound system , and the lights came down . And I got down on one knee and written across the <unk> in the stars were the words &quot; Will you marry me ? &quot;
And the ring , was the size of my <unk> !
Yeah uh , Phoebe ! Look umm , I want to apologize about before , okay ? We were being jerks . Parker &apos;s a nice guy and I &apos;d like to get to know him .
Then you better do it now .
Why ?
Because I &apos;m going to kill him
What-what ?
You guys were right . He &apos;s just too excited about ... everything . I mean I &apos;m all for living life , but this is the Geller &apos;s 35th anniversary . Okay ? Let &apos;s call a <unk> a <unk> this party <unk> .
I know I &apos;m having the worst time . There was a <unk> line for the <unk> , and when I finally got up to the <unk> , I <unk> on a giant <unk> !
Are you sure it wasn &apos;t an <unk> ?
I guess it could &apos;ve been , I didn &apos;t really look at it . Y &apos;know , I just <unk> it on Chandler &apos;s coat and got the hell out of there .
He &apos;s just such a great guy I &apos;m so excited about him .
Oh hey , you should be excited about him . There &apos;s nothing wrong with him he &apos;s a good guy .
You think ?
Yeah . Ya know what I think ; I think we were all just being too negative .
You &apos;re right . You &apos;re right , he &apos;s just <unk> life . We could all stand to be a little more like Parker . You know what ? I am like him ! I &apos;m a <unk> , positive person .
Actually , you have a little bit of an edge .
What &apos;s that now ?
Nothing ...
Oh look it &apos;s Parker !
Look ! It &apos;s the bunny hop !
Oooh I love it !
You do ? !
Are you kidding ? People acting like animals to music . Come on !
Okay it &apos;s time for the toast ! Umm now-now , I know that Ross usually gives the toast , but this year I &apos;m going to do it .
No , no it &apos;s going to be great . Really ! Mom , Dad , when I got married , one of the things that made me sure I could do it was the amazing example the two of you set for me . For that and so many other things I want to say thank you . I know I probably don &apos;t say it enough , but I love you . When I look around this room , I &apos;m-I &apos;m <unk> by the thought of those who could not be here with us . Nana , my <unk> grandmother who would so want to be here , but she can &apos;t because she &apos;s dead . As is our dog Chi-Chi . I mean look how cute she is . . Was . Do me a favor and pass this to my parents . Remember she &apos;s dead . Okay , her and Nana , gone . Wow ! Hey does anybody remember when <unk> <unk> had to say goodbye to her children in <unk> of <unk> ? Didn &apos;t see that ? No movie fans ? ! You want to hear something sad ? The other day I was watching 60 Minutes these <unk> in Romania , who have been so <unk> , they were <unk> of love . You people are made of <unk> ! Here &apos;s to mom and dad ! Whatever !
Thank you Monica that was uh , interesting . Wasn &apos;t it interesting , Jack ?
Why don &apos;t I remember this dog ?
Ross , why don &apos;t you give us your toast now ?
Oh , no , Mom , it &apos;s just Monica this year .
You &apos;re not going to say anything ? On our 35th wedding anniversary ?
No , of course , Um ... Um , everybody ? Um , I-I just wanted to say ... on behalf of my new bride , Rachel , and myself . Umm , that if ... if in <unk> years , we &apos;re half as happy as you guys are , we &apos;ll count ourselves the luckiest people in the world .
Oh Ross ...
I just wish Nana were alive to hear Ross &apos;s toast .
My God what a <unk> well lit hallway !
Can I get you something to drink ? Like a water and <unk> ?
I must say this apartment , its , its , There are no words ...
Oh thank God .
It &apos;s a haven . A <unk> <unk> . A <unk> <unk> in the <unk> ...
Yeah ? I know ! I know ! Uh huh ? Listen why don &apos;t we just um , sit and relax ? You know just be with each other . <unk> !
That sounds great . My God this is the most comfortable couch I &apos;ve ever sat on in my entire life .
Let &apos;s try something else , let &apos;s play a game .
I love games !
<unk> ! Let &apos;s play the game of who can stay quiet the <unk> .
Or ... <unk> .
But , let &apos;s play this one first . And remember whoever talks first loses !
I lose , now <unk> .
Oh my God ! Oh my God !
Is something wrong ?
Wrong ? Really ? You know the word wrong . Everything isn &apos;t perfect ? Everything isn &apos;t magical ? Everything isn &apos;t a <unk> with the light of a million <unk> ? They were just <unk> lights , Parker !
Well , excuse me for putting a good spin on a <unk> jam !
You don &apos;t have to put a good spin on everything .
I &apos;m sorry that &apos;s who I am . I &apos;m a positive person .
No ! I am a positive person . You are like Santa Clause on <unk> , at <unk> , getting <unk> !
So what do you want me to do , you want me to be more negative , less happy ?
<unk> less happy !
Fine ! Well then to <unk> Ross , &quot; I &apos;d better be going . &quot;
So long ! Don &apos;t let the best door in the world hit you in the ass on your way out !
Isn &apos;t this the most incredible fight you &apos;ve ever had in your entire life ?
Uh huh .
... and then , we could &apos;ve gone from the ceremony to the reception with you in the <unk> !
Ross , it just wouldn &apos;t have been <unk> .
But having a <unk> place the ring on your finger would &apos;ve been no problem ?
It was really fun being married to you tonight .
Yeah ! And ! And , it was the <unk> 400 bucks I &apos;ve ever made .
Okay Ross , can I uh , can I ask you something ?
Yeah .
That proposal , at the planetarium ...
I know , I know it was stupid .
Are you kidding ? ! With the , with the <unk> , and-and the song , and the stars ! It was ... really wonderful ! Did you just make that up ?
No , actually I thought about it when , when we were going out . It &apos;s how I <unk> I uh , I would ask you to marry me .
Well , that would &apos;ve been very hard to say no too .
It &apos;s a good thing I didn &apos;t do it , because it sounds like it would &apos;ve been a very expensive wedding . Okay , good night .
<unk> .
Even if the <unk> had a <unk> so your hair wouldn &apos;t get messed up ?
I will think about it .
That &apos;s all I &apos;m <unk> &apos; .
Okay that &apos;s it . I give up . At mom and dad &apos;s <unk> anniversary , you &apos;re the one giving the speech .
Y &apos;know I don &apos;t understand why they didn &apos;t cry . It was a beautiful speech .
Oh , come on .
Hey ! All that stuff you said about true love , you were right , I mean , we did learn a lot from Mom and Dad ! And that picture of Chi-Chi with her mischievous <unk> . And what you said about Nana . Ohh , yeah she really would &apos;ve wanted to be there . And you know what ? I think she was .
Oh good God , Ross ! How the hell do you do it ?

So did they call you to tell you your name &apos;s gonna be in this ?
No . They really like me over there . They want to do a big <unk> on me , but I said no .
Why &apos;d you say no ?
Remember what happened the last time I did an interview for them ? I said I write a lot of my own lines , and then the <unk> got mad and made my character fall down the elevator shaft . So who knows what I might say this time .
If only there was something in your head to control the things you say .
Oh , come on Joey ! You will totally keep it in check this time , and plus y &apos;know the <unk> would be really good for your career ! And you deserve that ! And if you do the interview you can mention , oh I don &apos;t know , gal pal Rachel Green ?

Okay , don &apos;t listen to him . Please ?
Fine ! All right , I &apos;ll do it . But hey ! You guys have to be at the next table so you can stop me if I y &apos;know , start to say something stupid .

Oh , I told the stripper to be here at five . That &apos;s good right ?
You ordered a stripper for the shower ? ! That is totally inappropriate !

She &apos;s still mad .
Yeah I know . Isn &apos;t it great ? One less person we have to make small talk with .
Phoebe , <unk> &apos;s mad at you too . It-it doesn &apos;t bother you ?
No look , we &apos;ve apologized twice ! I can &apos;t do anymore than that . I know you hate it when people are mad at you but you just have to be okay with it .
Okay . I can do that . I gotta go powder my ass .
Look at that face ! Just like when you were in high school ! If I didn &apos;t know better I &apos;d say you were a cheerleader in trouble . Come on , let &apos;s get some tea .
Okay .
Oh my look at that . Only three weeks to go , now have you picked your nanny yet ? Now I don &apos;t want you to use your <unk> &apos; cause it would just split her focus .
Oh well actually gonna use a nanny and uh , I don &apos;t even have a <unk> .
It &apos;s like you &apos;re a <unk> person . Rachel , you must get a nanny . You don &apos;t know how overwhelming this is going to be . I mean when you were a baby I had full time help , I had Mrs. Kay .
Mrs. Kay ! Oh yeah , she was sweet . She taught me <unk> . I actually think I remember some of it , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> a sweet woman .
Well , <unk> great she was I just can &apos;t afford that .
Oh Rachel !

Oh , I &apos;m so happy I &apos;m gonna do this for my little girl . Aw , look at you . You have tears in your eyes .
Yes . Yes I do .
All right Ross you &apos;re in the lead , would you like to take another question or spin the Wheel of Mayhem ?
The wheel has not been my friend tonight Joey . Uh , I &apos;ll take another question .
Okay , this is gonna be tough . Hold your breath .
It &apos;s okay , I &apos;m ready .
No dude , you gotta hold your breath until you &apos;re ready to answer the question .
This is ridiculous , he &apos;s not gonna hold his breath ...
Okay , what do you have a fear of if you <unk> from this <unk> , <unk> ... <unk> cow , that &apos;s a big word . <unk> ... Seriously look at this thing . Chandler , how do you say that ?
Let me see that .
This one right here .

The fear of <unk> !
No ! No , fear of the number 13 .
<unk> of <unk> ?
It &apos;s possible , they have really <unk> edges .
All right Chandler , you &apos;re up .
Wait a minute , I-I believe I &apos;m <unk> to use my <unk> <unk> for a free turn ?
This game makes no sense !
Y &apos;know what ? You &apos;re just upset because you &apos;re losing .
Oh come on Ross , I think we &apos;re all losers here .
All right . Chandler , you can either spin the wheel or pick a Google card .
Let me think . Let me <unk> ! I don &apos;t care .
You-you must choose Mr. Bing .
Either , it makes no difference .
<unk> , you jackass !
I &apos;ll take a card .
Okay , you picked the <unk> card ! You get all of Ross &apos;s points !
What ? !
This game is kinda fun .
You don &apos;t think it &apos;s a little crazy that you get all my points just &apos; cause you ...
I don &apos;t think the contestants are supposed to speak to each other .
Why did you invite my mother ? !
What ?
She wants to move in with me and Ross to help take care of the baby .
For how long ?
Eight weeks . I mean I love my mother , but my God , a long lunch with her is <unk> .
I personally would be <unk> if she wanted to live with me .
She can &apos;t hear you .
What ? You guys , come on ! What am I going to do ?
Well , if you don &apos;t want your mother to move in with you , just tell her .
You &apos;re right . You &apos;re right . I mean I &apos;m about to have a baby , I can tell my mother that I don &apos;t want her to just be sleeping on my couch ! Oh my God ! She &apos;s gonna want to sleep in my bed with me . This cannot happen !
That &apos;s right . That is right , you go over there and tell her you don &apos;t want her to live with you . Do not take no for an answer !
Okay .
This is great ! Now she &apos;s gonna be mad at Rachel ! Y &apos;know what ? And I &apos;m just gonna swoop in there and be like the daughter she never had .
I have new respect for Chandler . All right everybody ! It &apos;s time to open the presents !
Yes ! Yes ! And I think that the first gift that Rachel <unk> should be from the grandmother of the baby , because you &apos;re the most important person in this room . And in the world !
Well uh , I don &apos;t have a gift because I wasn &apos;t invited until the last minute , but thank you so much for bringing that to everyone &apos;s attention .
How about you less important people , let &apos;s open your presents !
Mom that &apos;s okay that you didn &apos;t get you a gift !
Well , I kinda did . Me . Eight weeks of me .
Oh yeah . Okay , see mom , the truth is I can do this on my own .
Sweetheart I know you &apos;re gonna be terrific mom , I just think you need a little help , especially at the beginning .
But mom , I really know what I &apos;m doing . I can handle this .
Really ? Remember <unk> ?
He was a hamster ! I am not going to <unk> up my baby !
Okay , come on Rach it &apos;s present time ! Y &apos;know you &apos;re the <unk> that &apos;s holding this whole party together . It &apos;s kinda falling apart here .

What ? ! It goes ten times a day ! What are we feeding this baby ? ! Indian food ? !
No dear , that &apos;s what babies do .
Rachel , listen to your mother . She is very smart .
Plus , what are you planning on doing with the baby while you &apos;re <unk> out to the garbage ten times a day ?
I don &apos;t know , I &apos;d leave it on the changing table ? What ? ! What &apos;d I do ? What &apos;d I do ? !
You can &apos;t leave a baby alone !
Oh <unk> course I know that . I mean of course you never leave a baby alone ! I mean who <unk> wouldn &apos;t be safe as she would be with me , the baby <unk> . Oh God , okay . Y &apos;know what ? I think opening the presents right now is a little overwhelming right now . So I think umm , I &apos;m just gonna maybe open them a little bit later , but thank you all for coming . And for these beautiful gifts , and this basket is beautiful .

Either eat it , or be in it .
Spoon ? So , what do you think ?
I &apos;m torn , between my integrity and my <unk> to avoid a beating . But I must be honest , your soup is abysmal .

Welcome to <unk> to cooking . Now , before we start , can anyone tell me the difference between a <unk> sauce and a <unk> sauce ?

Um-hmm , that &apos;s good to know . But let &apos;s stop focusing on what you don &apos;t do , and start focusing on what you do do .
What I do do ... is manage to uh , create an <unk> of support for the people working with me .
I see . Nice <unk> on the do do thing by the way .
<unk> thing I &apos;ve ever done in my life .
You gotta go !
Oh !
Okay , don &apos;t worry . You &apos;re ready .
Really ?
Absolutely ! Just fight all your natural <unk> and you &apos;ll be great .
Okay .
Ah Monica , my star student .
Y &apos;know , you called me that before so I-I took the <unk> of fashioning a star out of <unk> <unk> . Now , no pressure , you like my cookies , you give me the star .
Oh , <unk> .

We &apos;re all <unk> here . Nobody knows what they &apos;re doing .
I do ! I &apos;m a professional chef ! Oh relax ! It &apos;s not a <unk> drama !
If you &apos;re a professional chef , what are you doing taking <unk> to <unk> ?
Yeah !
I &apos;m-I &apos;m sorry , it &apos;s just that umm ... Well I-I cook at this restaurant , Alessandro &apos;s , and umm I just got a really bad review ...
Oh Alessandro &apos;s ! I love that place !
You do ?
Oh yes ! You &apos;re an excellent chef ! As a person you &apos;re a little ...
Oh , I &apos;m totally crazy , but you-you like the food ?
Very much .
Okay then , I don &apos;t stink . I &apos;m a good chef . Okay .
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa ! I don &apos;t want to go . I &apos;m having fun .
Well actually , did either of you pay for this class ?
Hey-hey-hey , if my friend says it &apos;s time to go , it &apos;s time to go .
... also I was the point person on my company &apos;s <unk> from the <unk> to <unk> system .
You must &apos;ve had your hands full .
That I did . That I did .
So let &apos;s talk a little bit about your duties .
My duties ? All right .
Now you &apos;ll be heading a whole <unk> , so you &apos;ll have a lot of duties .
I see .
But there &apos;ll be perhaps 30 people under you so you can dump a certain amount on them .
Good to know .
We can go into detail ...
No don &apos;t I beg of you !
All right then , we &apos;ll have a definite answer for you on Monday , but I think I can say with some <unk> , you &apos;ll fit in well here .
Really ? !
Absolutely . You can relax ; you did great .
Yeah I gotta say thank you , I was really nervous . Y &apos;know I &apos;ve been told I come on to strong , make to many jokes , and then it was really hard to <unk> that <unk> thing . <unk> . <unk> ! Poo .
Poo ?
Oh my God this doesn &apos;t count ! Okay ? The interview was over , that was the real Chandler Bing in there , this is just some crazy guy out in the hall ! Call security ! There &apos;s a crazy guy out in the hall !
Poo ? !
I &apos;ll look forward to your call .
Hey .
Hi ! You &apos;re back from your date !
How are you ?

Uhh , it was fun . We , we just had coffee .
Oh uh-huh , uh-huh , coffee , a little <unk> under the table .
What &apos;s uh , what &apos;s going on ? Do you not , do you not like Katie ?
No ! No , she <unk> was nice . I mean , she &apos;s a little slutty , but who isn &apos;t ?
I liked her .
Of course you did Ross , you would date a gorilla if it called you Indiana Jones !
Did you get like a fresh batch of pregnancy hormones today ? !
No ! It &apos;s just that , Kate <unk> me .
Why ? What was wrong with her ?
There was nothing wrong with her ! All right ? She was perfectly lovely !
Okay , so what &apos;s the matter ?
I don &apos;t want you to date her !
Why ? What , what are you jealous ?
Yes ! And not because I want you to go out with me , but because I don &apos;t want you to go out with anybody ! Okay ? I know it &apos;s a terrible thing to even think this , and it &apos;s completely inappropriate , but I want you to be at my constant <unk> and call 24 hours a day ! I &apos;m very sorry , but that is just the way that I feel .
Okay .
What ? !
I won &apos;t date . I &apos;ll uh , I &apos;ll be here , with you , all the time .
Really ? But I &apos;m being so unreasonable .
<unk> , but you &apos;re allowed to be unreasonable . You &apos;re having our baby .
Oh Ross , thank you . Thank you .
Do you feel better ?
No , not really . You &apos;re pressing the baby into my bladder and now I have to pee . Sorry .

Okay . Okay . Because for a minute you said you ...

Oh , look ! <unk> for <unk> ! Want to feel good about yourself ?
What the hell !
Okay .
All right , let &apos;s start with some <unk> . Can anybody tell me what the difference between <unk> and <unk> is ?
Yeah , this was a stupid idea .

Well obviously I won &apos;t be able to come , for those of you who haven &apos;t checked their <unk> today is my due date . Well y &apos;know , I just want to take a moment and thank you guys for how great you &apos;ve been during this time . I really couldn &apos;t have done it without you . And I have loved these last nine months ! And even though I am so looking forward to the next part , I am really gonna miss being pregnant .
That &apos;s right , still no baby ! Come on people ! Please make some room !
Uh sweetie , maybe you &apos;d be more comfortable here ?
You . Like you haven &apos;t done enough .
Look , I-I know how miserable you are , I wish there was something I can do . I mean I wish I were a <unk> . Because with <unk> it &apos;s the male , they carry the babies . And then also umm , I &apos;d be far away in the sea .
God . I have never been so uncomfortable in my entire life !
Oh I know , I &apos;ve been there . I remember toward the end ...
Oh Phoebe , that &apos;s a great story . Can you tell it to me when you &apos;re getting me some iced tea ? Oh God , get out ! Get out ! ! Get out ! ! Get out ! !
Let &apos;s .
Hey ! Did you have the baby yet ?
Do you want me to come over there and sit on you ? &apos; Cause I &apos;ll do it .
What are you doing here so early ?
They sent me home from work . They were like , &quot; <unk> your maternity leave now ! Just rest , get ready for the baby . &quot; Well y &apos;know what ? <unk> &apos; em ! If they don &apos;t want me there , I &apos;ll just hang out with you guys .

One guest ? You told me I can have six tickets !
Well , I sold four of them on <unk> . You &apos;ll be sitting next to <unk> .
Oh my God . So that &apos;s it ? ! I only get to bring one guest ?
Yeah , what time do you wanna pick me up ? Hello ?
Did you hear that ? I only get one extra ticket to my premiere . So some how I have to pick between you three and Ross .
What-what about me ?
You said you didn &apos;t want to go .
I don &apos;t . But I would still like to be <unk> . What ? Just because I &apos;m pregnant you think I &apos;m invisible .
Definitely not invisible .
Well , well Ross didn &apos;t care enough to be here , so I think he &apos;s out . You <unk> you lose .
He &apos;s not <unk> , he &apos;s teaching a class .
Well then somebody &apos;s <unk> . Joey , not that this uh should <unk> you at all , but if you were to pick me , I was planning on wearing a <unk> dress , cut down to here .
I haven &apos;t seen this dress .
Star in a movie .
Joey , you pick who ever you want . Okay ? You just listen to your heart . What does it tell you ? Phoebe , Phoebe .
Well uh ... I think I want to take Chandler .
<unk> !
You really want to take me ?
Yeah ! Yeah ! I mean I &apos;m sorry , I wish I can take everybody , but y &apos;know Chandler always supported my career . He &apos;s paid for acting classes and head shots and stuff and well this will be my way of paying you back .
So you &apos;re never actually going to pay me back ?
Wait a minute , just because he paid for your head shots you &apos;re gonna take him ? Joey , I don &apos;t think you &apos;re <unk> just how slutty this dress is !
It &apos;s not just the stuff he paid for , I mean it &apos;s-it &apos;s everything . Y &apos;know ? He read lines with me . He-he went with me on auditions when I was really nervous , and then he <unk> me after I didn &apos;t get parts that I really wanted . You always believed in me man . Even , even when I didn &apos;t believe in myself .
I always knew you were gonna make it . I &apos;m so proud of you .
Thanks . That means a lot to me .
Mon , maybe one of these guys wants to wear your dress .
I &apos;m gonna go shave .
Yeah well , I &apos;m gonna go spit .
Oh , I have to pee . If I don &apos;t come out in five minutes it &apos;s because I &apos;ve choked to death on the potpourri stink .
When she comes out , you hold her nose , I &apos;ll blow in her mouth , and the kid will just right out of her .
She &apos;s over a week late ! She gotta have it today , right ?
I don &apos;t know . I-I think it &apos;s still gonna be a while .
Hmm , care to make it interesting ? I &apos;ll bet you that she &apos;ll have it by this time tomorrow .
You &apos;re on !
Okay , how much ?
One hundred thousand dollars !
How about fifty bucks ?
Fine ! I &apos;ll call <unk> and move some money around .
All right , who &apos;s turn is it to help me get up !
No one &apos;s here ! Oh damnit !
This is so exciting ! It &apos;s so <unk> ! People taking our picture . How do I look ?
A little tall .
What ?
Do you mind <unk> down a little bit , so that I look taller ? There you go .
It &apos;s just so <unk> .
Oh hey Mon ? Rach is here ! Ohh , you &apos;re still pregnant . Oh , I &apos;m sorry . I know how uncomfortable you are . Y &apos;know what ? You look great . Yeah , like fifty bucks .
Oh , I have to go pee . Apparently this baby thinks that my bladder is a squeeze toy .
Damnit ! Damnit ! ! Here &apos;s your fifty bucks !
It &apos;s interesting that you lost . Now , I forget , do you like to lose ?
Now stop it ! Double or nothing that she has it by tomorrow !
Fine ! You &apos;re on !
Okay .
Until then , General <unk> , why don &apos;t you set up camp right there .
Hey is Rachel here ? We have a doctor &apos;s appointment .
She &apos;s in the bathroom .
Rach , we gotta go .
In a minute ! ! !
People ask me why we &apos;re not together , I just don &apos;t know what to tell them .
All right , all right . Let &apos;s go !
Uh , do you wanna go change first ? The doctor &apos;s keeping the office open late for us , but if you hurry ...
No , I &apos;m fine .
Really ? You don &apos;t think that &apos;s a little inappropriate .
Good God man don &apos;t anger it .
Ross , it is 100 <unk> outside . For the first time in weeks , I am <unk> comfortable .
Fine ! Fine ! Y &apos;know what ? Whatever you want . Okay ? You &apos;re the mommy .
Oh uh-uh pal ! Don &apos;t call me mommy ! It &apos;s bad enough you call your own mother that .
I &apos;m actually with her on this one .
&quot; I thought I knew who the <unk> was , but it was you all along . &quot;
Okay , this is it . It &apos;s my big fight scene coming up .
Ross .
Yeah ?
Can I ask you something ?
Uh-huh .
When Carol was pregnant with Ben ...
Mmm ?
... were you this <unk> ?
Wow !
Excuse me ? !
Oh nothing . Nothing ! Just uh , you &apos;ve been a little short with me lately . I &apos;m not trying to <unk> you .
Well then you just must have a natural <unk> for it .
Y &apos;know what ? The doctor will be in soon , why don &apos;t we not speak until then .
Okay . Seriously , breathe <unk> Ross ! That &apos;s great !
Y &apos;know we should probably ask the doctor if she even knows how to <unk> a baby that &apos;s half human and half pure evil !
Hi Dr. Long , how are you ?
Oh , you &apos;re nice to her .
She has the drugs !
We &apos;ll do a quick check .
Okay .
So , eight days late huh ?
Yeah .
You must be a little uncomfortable .
Eh , just a <unk> .
You &apos;re about 80 percent <unk> , so you &apos;re on your way . It still could last a little while longer . If you &apos;re <unk> there are a few ways to help things along .
Do them ! !
Actually , they &apos;re things you can do . Just some home <unk> , but in my experience I &apos;ve found that some of them are quite effective .
Well , we are ready to try anything .
Okay , there &apos;s an herbal tea you can drink .
Okay .
You can take some <unk> oil , there &apos;s eating spicy <unk> ...
Great ! We will do all of those .
... taking a long walk , and then there &apos;s the one that &apos;s proved most effective : sex .
You &apos;ve got to be kidding me !
Good job Joe ! Well done ! Top notch !
You liked it ? You really liked it ?
Oh-ho-ho , yeah !
Which part exactly ?
The whole thing ! Can we go ?
Oh no-no-no , give me some specifics .
I love the specifics , the specifics were the best part !
Hey , what about the scene with the kangaroo ? Did-did you like that part ?
I was surprised to see a kangaroo in a <unk> War I epic .
You fell asleep ! ! There was no kangaroo ! They didn &apos;t take any of my suggestions ! That &apos;s for coming buddy . I &apos;ll see you later .
Don &apos;t go ! I &apos;m sorry . I &apos;m so sorry ! Look ! This guy fell asleep ! He fell asleep too ! Be mad at him ! Or , call an <unk> .
Hey !
Hey .
Hi !
What did the doctor say ? Any news on when the baby will come ?
No . But she did give us some ideas on how to <unk> labor .
Yeah , we tried them all . We went for a walk , uh we tried a special tea , <unk> oil , spicy food nothing has worked .
Well , there is one thing that we haven &apos;t tried , but someone thinks that , &quot; That will open up a can of <unk> . &quot;
Well what is it ? What is it ? If it &apos;s gonna help bring the baby here , like today . I mean , I think you should do it .
It &apos;s sex .
Do it !
Monica !
I &apos;m just saying it &apos;s been a really long time for you . I mean , women have needs . Do it , get yours !
Oh I-I don &apos;t know about that . No , I think that if the two of you had sex <unk> <unk> would be <unk> .
All right , let &apos;s be practical , if Ross isn &apos;t willing to do it , he &apos;s not the only guy in the world you can have sex with . You can borrow <unk> is good !
Monica , what is the matter with you ?
Nothing . I just want the baby to be born today .
Why ? Why today ?
Okay fine ! I keep betting Phoebe that you &apos;re gonna have the baby and I don &apos;t want to lose again !
What ? ! While she &apos;s been going through this hell , you &apos;ve been making money ? ! You &apos;re betting on your friend staying in this misery ? !
I &apos;ll take that bet .
What ? !
Well , I &apos;m miserable here ! I might as well make some money out it !
Can I get some of that action ?
Wait a minute ! Now I &apos;m betting against all three of you ?
Oh honey , don &apos;t worry . I really do feel like tomorrow &apos;s the day .
Oh , okay !
Hey ! <unk> beauty !
Where have you been ? ! I tried to call you ! I want to talk to you ! I still feel so bad !
Oh no , were you upset ? Did you lose sleep ?
I &apos;m so sorry .
Uh-huh look , the only reason I can over here was to settle things between us ! Okay ? You &apos;ve done a lot for me and my career , I wanted to pay you back so I took you to the premiere but you missed it ! Okay , so how much do I owe you ?
What ? !
Give me a number , I don &apos;t want to owe you anything !
You don &apos;t owe me anything , I don &apos;t want you money ...
Ah-ah-ah ! We &apos;re doing this ! Okay , now you got me my first set of head shots . Right , how much were those ?
I don &apos;t know , five hundred dollars ?
Okay , five hundred dollars . What else ?
Well then there was the second set , the <unk> <unk> head shots .
Okay , so that &apos;s another five hundred . Five hundred and five hundred , that &apos;s ...
Do you want a <unk> ?
Please !
Here !
All right , what else ?
Well uh , there was acting classes , stage <unk> classes , tap classes ...
Which we &apos;re still keeping under our hats !
Uh then there was that <unk> coach who helped you with that play where you needed a southern accent . Which after twenty hours of lessons still came out <unk> .
What the hell are you talking about , &quot; The south will <unk> again man . &quot;
Yes , money well spent !
Yeah . Okay , what else ? <unk> !
Okay , two , three years of rent , <unk> , food ...
Okay . Okay , so I &apos;m writing you a check for ... So you fell asleep during my movie . Big deal right ? How do you clear this thing ?

Ross <unk> tried all the spicy food . It &apos;s not working .
Okay here , have one of these <unk> . Oh ha ... Oh God ! So ... so hot ! Oh <unk> By the way , you don &apos;t want to touch the <unk> and then touch your eye .
I am feeling nothing . <unk> of hot , watching you do that really makes me want to have sex with you .
Stop it .
Oh come on Ross , why are we wasting our time with this other stuff ? ! We know what &apos;s gonna work ! It &apos;s doctor <unk> !
I &apos;m sorry , but we have to have some <unk> ! My God , I &apos;m dying .
Oh come on Ross , we &apos;ve done it before we &apos;ll do it again , it &apos;ll be a nice way to <unk> the pregnancy .
This is insane , I &apos;m not gonna make love to you just so that you &apos;ll go into labor .
Make love ? What are you a girl ?
Always a great way to get in a man &apos;s pants .
But you will , you will be <unk> a service . Okay ? Just-just think of me as a ketchup bottle , y &apos;know you sometimes you have to bang on the end of it just to get something to come out .
I love when you talk dirty to me .
Oh , I know it . You &apos;re right . That &apos;s not sexy . Oh ... Oh ! Whoops ! Oh , I seem to have dropped my <unk> . Let me just bed over and get it . Oh God !
Okay enough ! This is , this is not going to happen .
Come on Ross ! I &apos;m miserable here ! Come on ! You started this , now you finish it ! Come on <unk> , make love to me .
Y &apos;know what ?
What ? !
Forget it .
Oh wow ! What now Ross you &apos;re not gonna talk ? How on <unk> will you ever <unk> me ? Oh wait a minute , I know . I mean you &apos;d think the damn <unk> would &apos;ve <unk> up your <unk> , but no ! ! That &apos;s not enough ... What are you doing ? !
