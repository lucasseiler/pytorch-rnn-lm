Okay , okay , okay , I &apos;ve got two cabs and no people . Go ! Go ! Go !
Maybe we could call the phone company . Maybe they could change the message . Maybe they can change his number .
Yeah , after this , I think he &apos;ll be doing that himself .
Rachel ! ! Wow ! You , uh , you look , wow !
And I still have about five seconds to spare . Okay , that was about seven seconds .
So we &apos;re a little late .
Come on . Oh ! And , uh , by the way ....

I didn &apos;t know there were docks .
Hey .
Hey .
Aww , is it broken ?
No , I gotta wear this thing for a couple weeks .
Did you tell the doctor you did it jumping up and down on your bed ?
Nooo . I had a story all worked out but then Chandler sold me out .
Well , I &apos;m sorry Joe . I didn &apos;t think the doctor was gonna buy that it just * fell * out of the <unk> .
What is this ? Fruit ?
Monica &apos;s making jam .
Whoa , jam ! I love jam ! Hey , how come we never have jam at our place ?
Because the kids need new shoes .
I &apos;m going into business people . I &apos;m sick and tired of being depressed about Richard . I needed a plan , a plan to get over my man . What &apos;s the opposite of man ? Jam . Oh Joey don &apos;t ! It &apos;s way to hot .
This will just be my batch .
Um , that &apos;s it . No . Hey ! You ! <unk> <unk> guy . Yeah . Why have you been following me ? I mean , all week long everywhere I look there &apos;s you .
You wouldn &apos;t return my calls , you sent back my letters ....

Um , yeah , you want Ursula , and I &apos;m Phoebe . <unk> sisters ! Seriously .
Oh , that &apos;s great . I &apos;m <unk> the wrong woman . I am such a dingus !
Oh , you &apos;re not a dingus .
I just , I want you to know I didn &apos;t used to be like this . Before I meet your sister I was like this normal guy who sold <unk> and <unk> phones .
Well , I mean look it &apos;s , it &apos;s not your fault , you know . I mean this is just what , what she does to guys , okay .
Well thanks .
Wait , you know what , I got a little story . When I was in <unk> High School I went through this period where I thought I was a witch . And there was this <unk> counselor who said something to me , that I think will help you a lot . He said okay , &apos; you &apos;re not a witch you &apos;re just an average student . &apos; See what I &apos;m saying ?
Not really .
Um , well , get over it . So , I mean you , you just seem to be a really nice guy , you know . Don &apos;t be so hard on yourself okay .
Wait . You &apos;re right . I know you &apos;re right . And , thanks for being so nice . Here
Oh , thanks a lot . Do you want to get a cup of coffee ?

Wait a minute , look .

Look , look , look .
What , what , what ?
It &apos;s an empty apartment .
Oooh .
We &apos;re all alone in an empty apartment .
Honey , come on , I have to be at work in like ten minutes Oh , all right , well it &apos;s not like I &apos;m <unk> of the year or anything .
There it is .
Oh , oh , that &apos;s what you &apos;re talking about . Hey .
Hey .
Do I look fat ?
Noo .
Okay , I accept that . When Janice asked me and I said no , she took that to mean that I was calling her a cow .
Okay , walk us through it , honey , walk us through it .
Okay , well . Janice said &apos; Hi , do I look fat today ? &apos; And I , I looked at her ....
Whoa , whoa , whoa . You looked at her . You never look . You just answer , it &apos;s just a <unk> . Do I look fat ? Nooo ! Is she <unk> than I am ? Noo ! Does size matter ?
Nooo !
And it works both ways .
Okay , so you both just know this stuff ?
Well you know , after about thirty or <unk> fights , you kinda catch on .
Okay , for instance . Let &apos;s say , Janice is coming back from a trip and she gives you two <unk> . Option number 1 she &apos;ll take a cab home from the airport . Option 2 is you can meet her at baggage claim . Which do you do ?
That &apos;s easy , baggage claim .
Wrong ! Now you &apos;re single . It &apos;s actually secret <unk> number three , you meet her at the gate . That way she knows you love her .
Okay , this is good , this is good . All right listen , I have one . Janice likes to <unk> , at night , which , you know I &apos;m all for . But , uh , you know when you want to go to sleep , you want some space . So , uh , how do I tell her that without , you know , accidentally calling her fat or something .
Oh honey , I &apos;m sorry we can &apos;t help you there , &apos; cause we &apos;re cuddlily sleepers . Okay , I &apos;m late for work .
Oh .
All right are you guys gonna come down ?
Uh , yeah , yeah I &apos;ll , I &apos;m right behind you .
Good luck Chandler .
Thank you Rachel .
Bye sweetie .
Bye hon .
Okay the sleeping thing . Very tricky business , but there is something you can do .
Well , I thought you guys were cuddlily sleepers .
Noo ! No , not cuddlily , not me , just her . I &apos;m like you , I need the room . Okay , come here . Okay , you &apos;re in bed ...
Yeah .
I &apos;m gonna use the cushion .
Yeah .
Okay , you &apos;re in bed . She &apos;s over on your side , <unk> . Now you wait for her to <unk> off , and then you hug her and roll her back over to her side of the bed . And then you <unk> <unk> . Hug for her ! Roll for you .
Okay , the old hug and roll .
Yep .
Okay , one question .
Shoot .
You &apos;re pretending the pillow &apos;s a girl right ?
Remember when you where a kid and your Mom would drop you off at the movies with a jar of jam and a little spoon ?
You &apos;re so pretty .
Hi !
Hey , Phoebe .
Hey , oh , you know that guy who &apos;s been following me ? I talked to him today .
You talked to him . Are you crazy ?
Okay , first I &apos;m not crazy . And second , say it don &apos;t <unk> it . Anyway his name is Malcom , and he wasn &apos;t following me , I mean he was , but &apos; cause he thought I was Ursula , <unk> . And , that &apos;s why , that &apos;s why he couldn &apos;t just come up and talk to me . &apos; Cause of the restraining order .
Umm , not feeling better &apos; bout Malcom .
Ooh ! No , no , no , no , he &apos;s not like a <unk> , no . He &apos;s just like this , this very passionate , incredibly romantic guy , that got like a <unk> bit carried away , you know . And we just get along really well , and he &apos;s so cute .
Oh my God , you &apos;ve got a crush on your sister &apos;s <unk> .
No , I &apos;m just gonna help him , you know , get &apos; <unk> &apos; , like you know , like I did for Joey after he went out with her .
Hey , I didn &apos;t stalk her . I mean
Okay , I asked for the news , not the weather .
Hey guys .
Hey Mon .
Joey , this is for you . It &apos;s <unk> <unk> .
Aww . Ohh !
Hey , Joe , I gotta ask . The girl from the Xerox place <unk> naked , or , or a big tub of jam .
Put your hands together .
Joey , take your time with that . That &apos;s my last batch .
No more jam ? !
Well , what happened to your jam plan ?
I figured out I need to charge seventeen bucks a jar just to break even . So , I &apos;ve got a new plan now . <unk> .
Well , your gonna need much bigger jars .
What are you talking about ?
I &apos;m talking about me having a baby .
What ?
Are you serious ?
Yeah . The great thing about the jam plan was , I was taking control of my life . So I asked myself , what is the most important thing to me in the world and that &apos;s when I came up with the baby plan .
Well , aren &apos;t you <unk> &apos; something ? What , what , what is uh , what is that guy &apos;s name ? Dad !
It took me 28 years to find one man that I wanna spend my life with , if I have to wait another 28 years then , I &apos;ll be <unk> before I can have a baby , and that &apos;s just stupid .
That , that &apos;s what &apos;s stupid .
I don &apos;t need an actual man , just a couple of his best swimmers . And there , there are places you can go to get that stuff .
Down at the docks again ?
Night-night Bing-a-ling .
Night-night ..... Janice . &apos; Look at all that room on her side , you good fit a giant penguin over there . That would be weird though . Okay , hug and roll time .

You &apos;re taking the word of a guy who has night vision goggles ?
What , he &apos;s not still following her . Do you think he is still following her ?
Pheebs , wake up and smell the restraining order .
What are you saying I should do ?
I think , that if you really like this guy , you should just trust him .
Thank you , Monica .

Oh , that &apos;s what I would do , forget mine .
Oh my God , what happened ?
Oh . God , crazy Chandler . He <unk> me ... off ... the ... bed !

Hoyt ?
It &apos;s a name , yeah . I saw you , you know , in this great house with a big pool .
Really , is he a swimmer ?
He &apos;s got the body for it .

You guys have one of those signs that says &apos; We don &apos;t swim in your toilet , so don &apos;t pee in our pool . &apos; , you know .

Two girls and a boy ?

Welcome everybody , welcome to Amazing <unk> !
Oh , oh ! It &apos;s on again !
You guys , can we please not watch this all right .
Shhhh !
Folks , has this ever happened to you . You go to the refrigerator to get a nice glass of milk , and these darn cartons are so flingin &apos; -flangin &apos; hard to open .
Oh , you said it Mike . Aw ! There &apos;s got to be a better way !
And there is Kevin .
Can we please turn this off ?
Noo way , Kevin .
There is a <unk> new product that <unk> that you &apos;ll never have to open up milk cartons again . <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Are you intrigued ?
You &apos;re flingin &apos; -flangin &apos; right I am !
Keep in mind , he &apos;s never used this product before , you &apos;re gonna see how easy this is to do . Go ahead . This works with any milk carton .
Wow , it is easy . Now , I can have milk everyday .
Well , it &apos;s official there are no good movies .
Well , let &apos;s go to a bad one and make out .
Perhaps , you would like me to turn like this , so that you can bunny bump against my back .
Hey !
Hey .
Hey , man . What &apos;s up ?
Maybe you can tell me . My agent would like to know why I didn &apos;t show up at the audition I didn &apos;t know I had today . The first good thing she gets me in weeks . How could you not give me the message ? !
Well , I &apos;ll tell ya I do enjoy guilt , but , ah , it wasn &apos;t me .
Yes , it was ! It was him ! Uh huh ! Okay , it was me !
How is it you ?
Well , it was just , it was all so crazy , you know . I mean , Chandler was in the closet , counting to 10 , and he was up to 7 and I hadn &apos;t found a place to hide yet . I-I-I meant to tell you , and I wrote it all down on my hand . See , all of it .
Yep , that &apos;s my audition .
See , now this is why I keep <unk> everywhere .
Yep , and that &apos;s why we don &apos;t invite you to play .
What is the great <unk> here ? You go get yourself another appointment .
Well , Estelle tried , you know . The casting director told her that I missed my chance .
That is unfair . I &apos;ll call her and tell her it was totally my fault .
Pheebs , you can &apos;t do that . The casting director doesn &apos;t talk to friends , she only talks to agents .
What a sad little life she must lead . Okay , ooh .
What , what are you doing ? What are you doing ?
No , no , no , I know , I know , ooh . &apos; Hi , this is <unk> , from Phoebe Buffay &apos;s office . Um , is um , Ann there for Phoebe , she &apos;ll know what it &apos;s about . &apos;
Hang up , hang up .
<unk> ! Hi . Listen we got a problem with Joey Tribbiani , apparently he missed his audition . Who did you speak to in my office ? Estelle , no , I don &apos;t know what I &apos;m going to do with her . No . All right , so your husband leaves and burns down the apartment , the world does not stop . &apos;
Is anybody else scared ?
<unk> , well look , um , if Joey loses this audition , that is it for Estelle . I don &apos;t care ! Annie you are a doll , what time can you see him ? &apos; I need a pen .
Get the woman a pad ! Get the woman a pad ! A pad ! A pad !
Oh , now you want a pad .
Hey ! !
There &apos;s my boy ! Here &apos;s my boy ! And here &apos;s his Barbi What &apos;s ah , what &apos;s my boy doing with a Barbi ?
He picked it out of the toy store himself , he loves it .
He <unk> it everywhere , it &apos;s like a security blanket , but with ski boots and a <unk> <unk> .
Yeah , it &apos;s , it &apos;s , it &apos;s cute . Why , why , why does he have it , again ?
So he &apos;s got a doll ? So what ? Unless you &apos;re afraid he &apos;s gonna grow up and be in show business .
This doesn &apos;t have anything to do with the fact that he is being raised by two women , does it ?
You know what it &apos;s fine . If you &apos;re okay with the Barbi thing , so am I.
Give daddy the Barbi ! Ben , give , give me the Barbi . Okay , how &apos; bout , don &apos;t you want to play with the monster truck ? No . Okay , oh , oh , how about a <unk> ?
Ross , you are so pathetic . Why can &apos;t your son just play with his doll ?
I gotta go to work . Has anybody seen my left boob ?
I love that movie .
There it is . Joey , what are you doing ?
I &apos;m sorry , it just felt nice .
Joe . Joe ! <unk> the phone .
Hey , I only got one good arm , you know . You should be doing stuff for me . Go get me a sweater .
Just do it ! Okay , it &apos;s Janice and if I get it I &apos;m going to have to see her tonight . Oh , that &apos;s great I &apos;m gonna have to see her tonight .
What &apos;s the big deal ? Why don &apos;t you wanna see Janice ?
Okay , last night at dinner , when the meals came , she put half her chicken piccata on my plate and took my tomatoes .
And that &apos;s bad because ... , you hate chicken piccata ?
Noo .
You didn &apos;t want to share your tomatoes , tomatoes are very important to you .
No , it &apos;s like all of the sudden , we were this couple . And this alarm started going off in my head &apos; Run for your life ! Get out of the building ! &apos;
Men are unbelievable .
What is it with you people ! I mean , the minute you start to feel something , you have to run away ?
I know , that , that &apos;s why I don &apos;t want to go tonight , I &apos;m afraid I &apos;m going to say something stupid .
Oh , you mean like that guy thing where you act mean and <unk> until you get us to break up with you .
Hey , you know about that ? !
Look what do I do ? I wanna get past this , I don &apos;t wanna be afraid of the commitment thing . I wanna go through the tunnel , to the other side !
Where there is no fear of commitment .
Do we have any ... Do we have any thoughts here ?
Well , I &apos;ve never been through the tunnel myself , &apos; cause as I understand it , you &apos;re not allowed to go through with more than one girl in the car , right . But , it seems to me it &apos;s pretty much like anything else , you know , face your fear . It have a fear of <unk> , you go to the top of the building ! If you &apos;re afraid of bugs ..... get a bug . Right . In this case , you have a fear of commitment , so I say you go in there and be the most <unk> guy there ever was .
<unk> , that makes sense .
You think ?
Oh , yeah . Go for it man , jump off the high dive , stare down the barrel of the gun , pee into the wind !
Yeah , Joe , I assure you if I &apos;m staring down the barrel of a gun , I &apos;m pretty much peeing every which way .
Oh , it &apos;s your audition from this morning . Can I use the phone again ?
Sure Pheebs , you know , that &apos;s what it &apos;s there for , emergencies and pretend agents .
Come on baby , come on !
<unk> , I have Phoebe Buffay returning a page . Okay , well , um , she &apos;s in her car I &apos;ll have to patch you through . &apos;
Very nice touch .
&apos;Okay , go ahead . &apos; Um , hi Annie . <unk> ! You got it . Oh , okay , um , &apos; Will he work for <unk> ? &apos; you ask me . Well , I don &apos;t know about that , except that I do and he will . Great , oh you are such a sweetheart . I would love to have lunch with you , how about we have lunch next .... Op , went through a tunnel .
Unbelievable .
Thank you so much .
It was really fun , I mean I &apos;ve never talked on a car phone before .
You were amazing , could you just do me this huge favor , you see there &apos;s this one other audition that I really , really want , and Estelle couldn &apos;t get me in .
Oh , I don &apos;t know . I mean it was fun one time .
Come on , please , it &apos;ll be just this one more , well actually it &apos;s two .
Two ?
Yeah ! Well , well really it &apos;s three . Please . You &apos;re so good at it . I love you .
Okay , I &apos;ll do it , but just these three , right
Nooo , four .
So , how come you wanted to eat in tonight ?
&apos;Cause , I wanted to uh , give you this .
Ohhh , are you a puppy ! <unk> paper ! I never really know what to say when someone you &apos;re sleeping with gives you contact paper .
Well , wait there &apos;s , there &apos;s more . See the contact paper is to go into your brand new drawer . See , the drawer actually goes in my dresser .
Oh , you didn &apos;t have to do this .
Yes , I did . Yes , I did . Because , you &apos;re my girlfriend , and that &apos;s what girlfriends should , should get .
Well , I gotta buy a <unk> . Because , oh my <unk> ! Who , would &apos;ve thought that someday , Chandler Bing would buy me a drawer .
Well , not me . But that &apos;s what &apos;s happened , and , ah , and , and there &apos;s more . We should take a trip .
We should ?
Yep , we &apos;re a couple and that &apos;s what couples do . And , I wanna meet your parents . We should take a trip with your parents !
I don &apos;t think we need to , because you &apos;re <unk> me out right now ! Are you okay ?
I am , I actually am . I mean this is amazing . My entire life I have <unk> this place , and now that I &apos;m here it &apos;s like what was the big deal . I could probably say &apos; Let &apos;s move in together . &apos; and I &apos;d be okay .
You probably want us to move in together ?
It doesn &apos;t scare me !
Yeah , well , it scares me ! I mean I not even divorced yet , Chandler . You know , you just invited me over here for pasta , and all of the sudden you &apos;re talking about moving in together . And , and I wasn &apos;t even that hungry . You know what , it &apos;s getting a little late , and I-I should just , um ...
Oh , no , no , no , don &apos;t go ! I &apos;ve scared ya &apos; ! I &apos;ve said too much ! I &apos;m hopeless , and awkward , and desperate for love ! ! Hey , Janice ! It &apos;s me . Um , yeah , I-I-I just wanna apologize in advance for having chased you down the street .
Honey , this will help .
So , I finally catch up to her and she says this relationship is going to fast and we have to slow down .
Uff .
That is never good .
Then I got all needy and clingy .
Okay , wait a minute , wait a minute , wait a minute . Maybe it &apos;s not so bad . How did you leave it ?
She said she &apos;d call me .
Ohh !
Oh God .
Welcome to our side of the tunnel .
This ice cream tastes like crap by the way .
Yeah , well that &apos;s that <unk> , <unk> dairy , <unk> milk junk . We sort of , we save the real stuff for those really terminal cases .
You know , when you start get screwed over all the time , you gotta switch to <unk> .
Yeah , you do .
So , you don &apos;t think I &apos;m terminal ?
Well , no , not at all , you &apos;re not terminal , you just , you just need some damage control .
Okay , okay . So , should I call her ?
Nooo !
This is a very <unk> time right now . If you feel yourself reaching for that phone , then you go shoe shopping , you get your butt in a bubble bath . You want her back you have to start acting aloof .
She has to know that your not ready .
Right . So , what you have to do is , you have to accidentally run into her on purpose . And then act aloof .

Hello , Janice .

Yeah , huh . I &apos;m just uh , you know I &apos;m just picking up some things for a party .

Well , I &apos;m sorry if my friends aren &apos;t as sophisticated as yours .
Where is this party ?
Here in Chelsea .
Who &apos;s party is it ?
A woman &apos;s
What woman ? !
Chelsea .
Okay , you know , one of two things is happening here . Either you &apos;re seeing somebody behind my back , which would make you the biggest jerk on the planet . Or , else you &apos;re pretending that you &apos;re seeing somebody , which just makes you so pathetic that I could start crying right here in the cereal aisle . So like which of these two guys do you want to be ?
Can I be that guy ?
Okay , so we got some more good <unk> , lots of stuff to work on .
Okay , shoot .
Okay , um , oh , the <unk> commercial .
I didn &apos;t get it ?
No . They said you &apos; Weren &apos;t believable as a human being . &apos; So , you can work on that .
Okay , what else ?
Um , the <unk> play people said &apos; You were pretty but dumb . &apos;
Oh .
Oh no wait , I &apos;m sorry , that &apos;s &apos; pretty dumb . &apos;
Look , it &apos;s okay , no , no , no , really , look um , I really appreciate this Pheebs , but I think I &apos;m gonna have to go back to Estelle .
Oh .
Yeah , well don &apos;t get me wrong , you &apos;re a better agent than she is , but at least with her I don &apos;t want to blow my pretty dumb brains out .
Yeah , no , I understand .
You do , thanks .
Yeah . Sorry .
Wait a minute .
What ?
Wait a minute , did you just make up all that stuff just to get out of being my agent .
Oh , you caught me . I am so busted .
That <unk> what I <unk> .
.... And then I just , you know , threw the bag of barley at her , and ran out of the store .
My God ! Chandler , we said be &apos; aloof &apos; not &apos; a <unk> &apos; .
I &apos;ve actually ruined this haven &apos;t I ? It &apos;s time for the good ice cream now , right ?
Yeah , it is .
You know what , everything &apos;s gonna be okay .
Hello . Hi , Janice ! Can you hold on for a second ? Okay . Okay , what do I do ?
Shhh ... I don &apos;t know what to do , this is totally <unk> .
If-if-if we ever did what you did a man would never call .
Yeah .
Hello !
Oh wait , you know what , I got it , I got it , pretend like you just woke up , okay , that will throw her off . Be sleepy .
Yes , and <unk> .
What are you , stop naming <unk> ! Hello , Janice . Hi , I &apos;m so glad that you called , I know I &apos;ve been acting a really weird lately . And , it &apos;s just because I &apos;m crazy about you , and I just got ... stupid , and , and scared , and .... stupid a couple of more times . I &apos;m sorry . Really ? ! Really ? !
